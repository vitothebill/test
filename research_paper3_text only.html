<p class=MsoNormal><b>The Great Rebundling is upon us.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Not long ago, TV watchers rebelled against the tyranny of
the cable “bundle”—paying $100 or more for a roster of dozens of channels, many
of which they never watched. They cut the cord and celebrated the joy of
ordering new streaming services one by one.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>But now the a la carte streaming menu is adding up to an
expensive meal of Netflix, Hulu, Disney +, HBO Max, Peacock, Paramount +, and
countless others. The industry’s major players are finding it harder to grow in
such a crowded market and are realizing they need to package their offerings in
new ways. That means less a la carte ordering and a new era of bundles.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Executives at Amazon AMZN 2.72%increase; green up
pointing triangle.com Inc. have considered selling clusters of rival streaming
services at a discounted price through the company’s Prime Video Channels
platform, according to people who have spoken to the company about the idea.
Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., WBD 2.48%increase; green up pointing triangle
which is already combining its HBO Max and Discovery+ streaming services, has
discussed eventually participating in new bundles with rivals, according to people
familiar with the situation.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Some streaming services are hoping to tack on their
services to retail memberships. Paramount Global struck a deal for its
Paramount+ streaming service to be offered as part of Walmart Inc.’s $98-a-year
Walmart+ membership program. Costco Wholesale Corp. has also engaged in similar
discussions with streaming services over the past year, according to people
familiar with the talks. Costco declined to comment.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>It’s a classic case of companies finding that when a new
business model runs into trouble, they can crib from the old business model.
What’s emerging isn’t anything like the traditional cable bundle; no one in the
streaming industry anticipates stitching all the big services together into a
$100-a-month package. But there’s a growing sense—from the companies and
consumers—that some level of bundling is a good thing.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>“We are not going back to cable,” said Devin Emery, chief
strategy officer of Curiosity Inc., whose documentary-focused service Curiosity
Stream has launched bundles with like-minded services. “Bundling itself is not
something people disliked. They didn’t like getting charged a lot of money for
a product they were using less and less.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Bundles and partnership talks are being driven, in part,
by the maturing of the U.S. market. Years into the streaming boom, it’s getting
tougher for companies to expand their subscriber bases, as Netflix Inc.’s loss
of customers over the past two quarters demonstrates. Plus, more consumers are
regularly turning services on and off when they are done watching hit content.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Entertainment companies are bundling their streaming
services and selling them at a discount.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Some companies are coming to the conclusion they will
need a dance partner to pursue growth instead of going it alone. Other
Hollywood giants realize they probably should have one major offering in the
marketplace, rather than two or three separate ones. Walt Disney Co., for
example, offers a package of Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ for $13.99 a month with
Hulu ads, a 44% discount compared with the cost of subscribing to all three
services individually.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Households are also scrutinizing their subscription
budgets as inflation rises. Beyond streaming video, many households have other
monthly subscriptions, from audio apps like Spotify to Peloton’s exercise
program to videogames. Consumers spend an average of $219 a month on
subscriptions, including cable and satellite TV, according to a spring survey
of 1,000 U.S. consumers by C+R Research.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>“I have so many subscriptions that I forget the ones I
have,” said Patrick McKee, a 38-year-old teacher from Camden, N.J. He and his
partner spend $360 a year on subscriptions, including to streaming services
such as Peacock, Paramount+ and Spotify, as well as the PlayStation Plus
videogame platform. That doesn’t include an additional payment for the
$139-a-year Amazon Prime free-shipping program, which includes access to Prime
Video.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Disney could roll

<p class=MsoNormal><b>For streaming rivals to strike partnerships, they must
overcome a number of challenges, including how much of a customer’s monthly fee
each party should get. They also haggle over who should be able to access
customer data and how to split advertising sales, people involved in making
such deals say. That helps explain why such talks in the industry have
progressed slowly.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The pacts can come with financial risks. Bundles and
promotions bring in less revenue per user than direct sales, and if a bundle is
available for only a limited time, many customers are likely to depart when it
expires. Some consumers barely log into services they receive as part of a
bundle; they are known in the industry as “zombie” subscribers.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Paramount Global spent a year negotiating its partnership
with Walmart, with each party agreeing to a marketing plan. The pact allows
Walmart to sell ad slots on Paramount-owned services such as Paramount+ and
Pluto as part of larger advertising deals, the people said. Walmart promotes
Paramount+ programming—including shows such as “Paw Patrol” and movies such as
“Top Gun: Maverick”—on the smart TVs in its stores as well as on its website.
Walmart also promotes Paramount+ on self-checkout screens in stores and gives
customers an option to subscribe to Walmart+ as well.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Under the terms of the deal, Walmart agreed to pay
between $2 to $3 per subscriber per month for Paramount’s ad-supported plan, so
long as the users activate their accounts, according to the people familiar
with the deal. In such partnerships, streaming services typically get around
half the per-user subscription revenue that they would by selling to consumers
directly. Paramount+’s ad-supported plan costs $4.99 a month.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>“It took a lot of time and effort to develop a business
model that works for both of us,” said Jeff Shultz, chief strategy officer and
chief business development officer of streaming at Paramount Global.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Under the plan Amazon has been exploring, it would sell
groups of streaming services through its Prime Video Channels offering at a
discount to what they cost separately, according to people familiar with the
situation. It is unclear if such bundles, should the company launch them, would
include Amazon’s own Prime Video service, the people said.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The streaming world is a lot to navigate for consumers.
There are now roughly a dozen major streaming video services like Netflix and
Hulu, which offer a broad lineup of content, plus a number of niche services
such as horror-focused Shudder and BritBox, which offers TV and movies from the
U.K. Several services, including Peacock and HBO Max, launched early in the
pandemic, when streaming use soared as households looked for in-home
activities.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>In a reversal of a longstanding dynamic in the cable TV
industry, packaging and bundling services could relieve some consumer
frustration with streaming’s rising costs and complexity. The traditional cable
TV bundle—with its packages of dozens or hundreds of channels, sold at
ever-higher prices—was so unpopular that it’s what drove many consumers to sign
up for streaming services in the first place.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>But as it turns out, some media executives say, a little
bit of packaging—and the economies of scale that it affords—can be a good
thing.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>“In many ways what’s starting to happen is the great
rebundling,” said Matt Strauss, chairman of Comcast Corp.-owned NBCUniversal’s
direct-to-consumer and international businesses. NBCUniversal’s Peacock has
discussed adding rival streaming services to its app, according to people
familiar with the discussions.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>There were some aspects of the cable bundle that made
sense: It made paying for at-home entertainment easier for consumers, said
Chris Cracchiolo, senior vice president and general manager of Walmart+. “You
have to manage so many relationships as a consumer today,” he said; bundles
offer simplicity.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Corporate mergers have been the catalyst for some
streaming packages.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The merger of WarnerMedia, owner of HBO Max, and
Discovery+ parent Discovery Inc. made it possible for the new Warner Bros.
Discovery to proceed with a plan to combine the two services.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Paramount Global—the result of the union of Viacom Inc.
and CBS Corp.—now sells its Showtime and Paramount+ services together for
$11.99 a month, a roughly 25% discount. The company is now considering phasing
out Showtime’s app altogether and moving its content into Paramount+.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Meanwhile, Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek hinted that
corporate consolidation could affect its plans for Disney+. Instead of just
offering a pricing bundle of Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, as it does now, the
company could put all the services into a single app, he said. That would
likely require Disney to buy out Comcast’s one-third stake in Hulu.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Some media executives predict even more consolidation
will be necessary to slim down the number of subscription streaming apps in the
market. “It’s M&amp;A that will drive bundling going forward,” said Andy
Forssell, the former head of HBO Max, who departed as a result of Discovery’s
merger with WarnerMedia.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>As they pursue such tie-ups, several of the big players
are raising prices for their flagship services or planning to do so, part of an
industry push to increase profits. Disney+ has said the price of ad-free
service will increase 38% in December to $10.99 a month, from $7.99, while the
CEOs of Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount have talked about the potential to
charge more.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jonathan Cook, who subscribes to the Disney
bundle—Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+—and Netflix, said he hasn’t been tempted to sign
up for other services, in part because he thinks prices already are high.
Instead, he watches some shows like Amazon’s “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings
of Power” or Apple TV+’s sci-fi drama “Foundation” at friends’ houses, instead
of purchasing his own subscriptions.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

Riverview, Fla., has access to six streaming services, but she pays for only
three of them, since she gets her Netflix and Paramount+ subscriptions through
T-Mobile.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The challenge for streaming services that participate in
such partnerships is ensuring consumers know about—and use—what they have.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Mr. McKee, the New Jersey teacher, recently learned he
could be getting Netflix, free of charge, through his T-Mobile subscription.
“With all of these bundles, you could have access to these services and not
even know,” he said.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Verizon Communications Inc., meanwhile, offers the Disney
bundle free to customers on its priciest mobile-phone plans. The two companies
have been partners since Disney+ launched in 2019.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Under the terms of their initial deal, Verizon and Disney
shared the cost of providing the service, which had a $6.99-a-month sticker
price, according to people familiar with the pact. Verizon then earned a
portion of revenue from people who became paying subscribers at the end of the
12-month promotion, the people said.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>BritBox International, a smaller streaming service that
has participated in bundles in overseas markets, said acquiring a customer
through a bundle is only part of the challenge. The real goal is to turn those
bundle subscribers into active users. “That’s pretty much the highest
determinant of whether or not they will stay a subscriber” when it runs out,
said Reemah Sakaan, CEO of BritBox International.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

streaming service specializes in programming from the U.K., including ‘Agatha

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Another way for streaming services to increase their
chances of getting new customers is to be part of new marketplaces that are
taking shape. Verizon is building a new system, called Plus Play, that lets
customers manage streaming subscriptions, including Netflix, Disney+ and
Peloton—and potentially new bundles, in one place.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>AT&amp;T Inc. is developing a similar marketplace, said
people familiar with the matter. And YouTube is pitching streaming services on
a marketplace it is developing that would make it easy for consumers to add new
subscriptions.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>If bundles do become widespread again, says Frank
Boulben, chief revenue officer of Verizon’s consumer group, “it won’t be at the
expense of the customer; it will be because the customer values it.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

She also hosts the downstream podcast, which is about the business of

the legacy media companies are in the middle of huge transformations.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>On the one side, Apple just won the Oscar for Best

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>On the other side is Disney: a company with a new CEO in
Bob Chapek, who is reorganizing the company around streaming — in the process,
irritating big stars like Scarlett Johansson and its own major studios like
Pixar by sending movies directly to Disney Plus instead of the theaters. But on
the flip side, Encanto became a sensation only after it left theaters and hit
the app. So I wanted to ask Julia how that shift was going and how Chapek’s
restructure was playing out after the storied tenure of his predecessor Bob

Welcome to Decoder.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Thank you for having me.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>You are the perfect person to talk about the whole
streaming TV industry, which is seeing a lot of change right now. I kind of
understood your job when you worked at The Verge and I had a feel for what it
was you did all day. What do you do as a senior strategy analyst at Parrot
Analytics?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The majority of my day is split between two things. In
the mornings I tend to do a lot of research projects — pouring over different
data that we are pulling via SQL and looking at trends to figure out what is
happening in the industry and what our clients can use from a strategic
standpoint to better their companies and their divisions, which tend to focus
on streaming. The latter part of my day is spent with a lot of clients across
the entertainment and media landscape trying to help them make sense of all of
this.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Are you allowed to reveal your clients? Can you give us a
general sense of what kind of companies come out to hire you or a firm like
Parrot?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Sure. I can’t talk about my clients, but across the board
we have certain clients we work with like Disney, WarnerMedia, Amazon, and a
bunch of different companies, mostly focusing on their direct consumer efforts.
Some try to focus on the linear while some look at other questions like what
programs to license or acquire, or what type of series they should be making
for underserved audiences; we pull a lot of that data and then help them in
that spectrum.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>One of the things that I think is really interesting
about streaming, in both a positive and negative way, is that there is more
data about what people are watching, who those people are, and what granular
elements of a show appeal to them. On the flip side, it doesn’t seem like
anybody knows how to measure anything and all of the measurements are
incompatible and not directly comparable. How do you make sense of that?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I think we have to examine what has shifted with the
measurement system. If we look back at what worked under the Nielsen method 20
to 30 years ago, it was this idea of what worked for advertisers, so it was
entirely based on consumption patterns. You could look at a very fixed
schedule, for example 8:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., on a Tuesday or Wednesday, and
Nielsen can say, “12 million people tuned in to watch Law &amp; Order.” <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay
Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here!<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>This is great for advertisers, and it’s great for NBC
because they get to charge higher rates. That relationship between customers
changes once it is direct-to-consumer. Now what you are trying to figure out is
the affinity — the adoration that certain customers have for certain shows,
certain characters, and certain franchises — so you can convince them to pay
you $10 to $15 a month, if not more in the next coming years.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>What we are trying to figure out is how to take the
subject of demand in an attention economy — which is a term everyone uses — and
monetize it. It is more than just consumption, it is a lot of asking questions
like, “Who is making TikTok edits? Who is on Twitter rallying people? Who is
figuring out ways to upload episodes of shows for people who do not want to
subscribe, but want to be able to engage in this type of series?” <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>So we use that and go to the companies to basically say,
“If you have their adoration — this concept of love which is hard to quantify
but is extremely important to the conversation in direct-to-consumer
relationships — then you are going to be okay. You are going to pull out with
continued customer acquisition and you are going to see lower churn rates and
higher retention.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>So let’s say I have a new service, called
thevergestreamingcompany.com, and I have one huge exclusive series to launch
with, but I know it is going to go away after two seasons. My huge worry is
that everyone is going to churn off and stop paying me once that second season
is over. Are you saying to launch new series, you have to make sure people love
them so they stay?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Yes. It’s the Apple equation to a certain extent, where
Apple TV Plus is batting above its average with originals. Even with how few
shows they actually have compared to everyone else, the demand for it is pretty
high and they are successful; they have Ted Lasso winning a bunch of Emmys, and
CODA, which just won best picture. Apple TV Plus has what we call
high-acquisition titles, which is where customers will sign up for them. What
they do not have, which is just as important, is the catalog demand. They do
not have any market share when it comes to actual catalog. When people are done
with CODA and they want to watch Seinfeld or New Girl, whatever it might be,
they do not have that. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I think that brings the question with Apple — and to an
extent with Disney Plus, which also has a really small catalog
market-share-wise compared to its competitors — of, “How much do you want to be
in this game?” If you want to be in this game, you have to have the
ten-thousand to twenty-thousand title back catalog that Warner, NBC, or
Paramount has. On the flip side, Paramount Plus and Peacock — which are from
Paramount and NBCUniversal — do not have the big titles that bring in people
that are saying, “Oh, well, I’ll sign up for this.” Half of Peacock’s stuff is
available on Hulu and people say, “Well, Hulu has titles I actually want to
watch, so I’m going to sign up for it and watch my NBC shows there.” This is
the moment we are in, trying to find that balance. New services really need
something exciting to bring in those first customers in the first place.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>That’s where you are focused; it seems that what you all
measure is social media activity as a proxy for affection. It sounds like the
equation here is that you need some new stuff which generates a lot of hype to
bring people in that you can convert into subscribers, and then you need a huge
catalog to retain them so they don’t stop paying you.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Yes. A big portion of my job is looking at usage in
household and demographics. If I look at a certain audience for a certain
platform, like HBO Max, my recommendation is going to say, “You have no shows
for teenage girls.” Teenage girls love consuming content, and they love making
content about the content they are watching. It is a huge market and is a
relatively cheap market, because it has a lot of reality, a lot of romance, and
to an extent action adventure.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>“Star Wars already exists; people who want Star Wars are
going to go to Disney Plus and they are going to get it.“<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>When we look at the data points, there is this huge
crossover with underserved audiences which tend to be young females and young
women of color, who are not served as well as men tend to be. Whenever I talk
to certain companies, a lot of the recommendations I bring up are, “You want to
make another Star Wars because you think that is the way to make a billion
dollars, but Star Wars already exists; people who want Star Wars are going to
go to Disney Plus and they are going to get it. There is a huge market with a
hole in it where you could just pivot towards focusing on them for a little
bit. You are then going to bring in your subscribers and reduce your churn.
Then by that metric, you are going to be able to increase your subscription fee
because you have low churn and can take that opportunity.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I realize this is your job, so you are going to tell me
that message is resonating, but I think this is the challenge of the whole
industry. The numbers are telling people where the money is and yet the market
doesn’t seem to be moving in that direction as fast as you would expect.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I think a lot of issues in the industry are communication
issues, and I don’t just mean between a boss and someone else via email. There
is this idea of “what can work” and “what will work,” versus “what may work.”
They are promising two to three times the growth on these streaming services
that are not profitable, but they are telling the street, “This is our future,
so we have to be profitable. We have to go big, so we are going to do the big
adaptation of the big IP and we are going to be in this place for $100 million
to $120 million, and we are going to own that.” <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Instead, you can do what Netflix did really well in 2014
to 2015, which was taking a lot of chances on content no one else wanted to
make and building its audience there, because there were huge audiences who
were vastly underserved.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The way that I tell clients to think of their platforms
is not necessarily as an entertainment service, but as a vertical of discovery.
It is a place for people to come and be introduced to something that they do
not even necessarily know that they want to watch, but that they might be
interested in. Once they do, now you can open them up to a whole new world of
content that is cheaper to make — animation and anime is a big one — and really
build up space there, where no one else wants to. To your point, that message
is lost when everybody is trying to make the next Marvel or the next DC, and
it’s such a limited number of companies who can do that from a rights
perspective. The interest in that is going to target the same group of people
over and over again. You have to expand beyond them.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>That is a good pivot to Disney and Marvel. Obviously the
Disney acquisition of Marvel under former CEO Bob Iger was a huge success
story. Are we now in Phase 45 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? I am going to
put out there that I actually think it would be better for Disney if this phase
was a failure. The previous three phases that ended with Avengers: Endgame were
huge successes, but I think it would be good for that company if they didn’t
just have this thing to milk, if they had to pivot. I think that brings us into
the current state of Disney. There was Bob Iger, now there is the new CEO, Bob
Chapek. You and I have discussed the many “Bobs” of the industry when you were
at The Verge on The Vergecast many times. Chapek was Bob Iger’s handpicked
successor; he is the guy now that Iger is out of the picture, and it doesn’t
seem like they like each other anymore. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The flash point was this bill in Florida that has been
nicknamed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. It limits how educators are allowed to
discuss sexuality and family structures in schools, in ways that probably
overstep because of the extreme ambiguity of the language in the bill. It seems
pretty obvious that Iger would have spoken up against the bill, since Disney is
a huge force in Florida. Chapek did not speak up loudly, which caused his
employees to walk out. He has since apologized to employees, and now Disney is
going to lobby against this bill, but the Republican government of Florida says
they are going to punish Disney. It seems frankly unconstitutional to use the
power of the state to take away Disney’s protections under Florida law, or — as
some Republican politicians are now arguing— that we should amend the copyright
terms of the United States. All of that seems crazy, but at the heart of it is
how Iger would have done it and how Chapek is doing it; that seems to have led
to a rift between the two.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Right. There are a multitude of issues within the
succession that has happened between Bob Iger and Bob Chapek, and I think a
really good way to think of it is through Jack Welch and Jeff Immelt at GE.
When Jack stepped down, he stayed around for an extra year and then Immelt, as
he might say, messed up around the early earnings; I believe he projected a $5
billion revenue, and it came around $3.2 billion. Jack went on publicly to say,
“Look, I would not have done it this way,” and he is very invested in this
company he led for 20 years. That puts Jeff Immelt in a really interesting
position where he says, “I do not want to go up against the guy who led this
company, who is beloved, but also it is my turn. I want to do what I’m going to
do with this company.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>That is very much where Iger and Chapek are. Iger is
still Disney’s largest single shareholder with 500,000 shares — about $71
million these days — which is a huge deal, so he is still in the company
regardless, and in a very big way. Now you have Chapek who fundamentally is so
different from Bob Iger. Bob Iger had this amazing emotional intelligence and
he was able to really connect with talent. He believed in having debates with a
lot of his executives and people in his C-suite; he wanted to have this constant
conversation about how to do things.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Bob Chapek surrounds himself with handpicked people —
which is not uncommon — who are relatively new to working with talent, are new
to representing Disney at a very public level, and most importantly, are new to
understanding how to view Disney. They are new on how to carry Disney not just
as a company, but as a brand that really resonates with consumers in a way that
very few companies do. You can compare it to Apple, where there is this genuine
adoration for not just the product, but for the company itself.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>When we think about that, there are three big issues. The
first one is how Bob Chapek seemingly communicates with his staff and the
greater public. With the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, Bob Chapek from the get-go does
not really communicate with people at Disney, many of whom belong to the LGBTQ
community and are allies of the community who support it. He does not
communicate that neither he nor Disney are going to take a public stance,
whereas in previous years, Iger and Disney would have. Instead he says, “Our content
is good enough to show that we support the LGBTQ community.” But it is not
because in China and in other countries, they get rid of any scenes that have
LGBTQ moments. This is an ongoing issue within the studios at Disney, who are
trying to fight this change. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Two, you have Bob Chapek arguing to some extent with the
leaders of the different studios and the different divisions at his company,
because he takes away something very boring called P &amp; L, which basically
means they are no longer in control of their budgets. The person now in control
of their budgets is a guy named Kareem Daniel, who has been Chapek’s right-hand
man since Daniel interned for him as an MBA student many years ago. He said,
“You are in charge of all of these creative fields, and you are going to be in
charge of the budget,” which does not jive well for Disney, a company where
each division was given control of their budget.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Three, which all leads to this point, is that Bob Chapek
is in a difficult position of trying to take Disney, a legacy company of
yesterday, and make it into a legacy company of tomorrow. That means becoming
more like a tech company rather than a traditional media and entertainment
company. He arguably runs it the way that some tech companies might, where he
breaks up the content production and the distribution. He goes in and says,
“This is how it is going to work; we are focusing on streaming, on the Metaverse,
and on how to get into these different positions.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>All of these issues happen at the same time. So it seems
like Bob Chapek is losing control of the kingdom, versus Bob Iger had control
over it. But what I think gets lost in that is that Bob Chapek is just over two
years into his tenure as CEO, and his first job was pulling the company out of
the pandemic and focusing on how to just survive it. Now he’s being tasked with
carrying the company very publicly in a way that generates support from the
shareholders, from the consumers, and from his employees. That’s easier said
than done, especially for someone who’s so new to the role.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>“The pattern of the visionary CEO who leaves and then
hands it over to the best operator of his crew instead of another visionary is
fairly common.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I feel like the pattern of the visionary CEO who leaves
and then hands it over to the best operator of his crew instead of another
visionary is fairly common. I would actually make the direct comparison to
Apple. Steve Jobs is the visionary. He hands over the company to Tim Cook,
who’s an operator. Tim Cook is massively successful as a CEO if you measure the
business performance of Apple, obviously, but no one’s running around saying
Tim Cook is a product visionary. I think he’s been good at carrying the cultural
legacy and the moral position of Apple as well. I don’t think there’s any
question there. But no one thinks that Tim Cook invented the AirPods. It’s just
not the role we ascribe to him. Do you think Chapek is a creative visionary the
way that Bob Iger was? Because Iger had credibility because all the creatives
believed in him.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Exactly, and no. I also think Chapek would argue that
he’s not a creative visionary in the way Bob Iger was — which is fine in a tech
world where your major concern is the product and this kind of consumer
experience in a very intimate way, if we think of how devices in our lives
exist — which I know you do, you think about quite often. Chapek is this guy
who is tasked with moving Disney as a creative company into a tech-oriented
role while remaining very, very in line with creatives. It’s the creative power
that makes Disney what it is.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>If we look at Scarlett Johansson and her lawsuit when she
sued Disney for how she felt she was treated with Black Widow moving to Disney
Plus during the pandemic, that is, at its core, the first moment people
realized this Bob Chapek is not like Iger. And that’s going to become an issue
when Disney is fighting for top talent for its franchises, for its new
franchises, for what it’s trying to do, especially with the theatrical
landscape having a revolution — in a positive, also in a negative way — and within
the studio landscape.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The idea of where do movies exist and how do we
compensate talent? How do we think about the power of a movie in a theater
versus what it looks like if we send it directly to Disney Plus? That is
something that’s happening with Pixar. Their movies are being sent to Disney
Plus, and that leads to jokes about Pixar being the next direct-to-video brand
for Disney, which is a studio that cost them $7 billion and really pulled
Disney animation out of the red in many ways.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>So when we see the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, there’s a
disconnect between how Chapek views his fiduciary duty, which is promising Wall
Street and his shareholders things like “we’re going to get to 230 to 260
million subscribers by 2024” — which is a daunting promise, a daunting
projection. At the same time, Chapek has to carry the brand that is Disney,
that stands up for the right reasons, that stands up in political and social
issues and humanitarian issues, that engages with artists and creatives, and really
understands how to talk to artists and creatives. Because talking to
distributors and your executive team [is] very different from talking to
someone who’s poured their heart into a role or into directing or into writing
a film.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>That is something he didn’t have too much experience
with; he did not come up through the studio on the creative side, he came up on
the distribution side. I think to your point about Tim Cook, it may make Chapek
a good CEO in five years when Disney is really in the middle of this move to
becoming a big tech platform, or the idea of tech being more integrated with
its actual core identity. Until then, he is still the head of a creative
company known for some of the best creative teams in the world. Unless you can
connect those together the way Iger did towards the end of his career — where
he really started to get into the streaming space and figure out what the next
move was — it is always going to be a tough battle internally and externally.
That is when you have questions from shareholders and the board that come into
play, such as, “Is this the right move? Is this the right guy?” I think he
needs time to prove himself and needs time to get out of all of these
situations that he has found himself in. It is a concern for people who really
support Disney because they are so used to Iger, a tough CEO to best no matter
who took over.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I don’t know that time solves the Republican party going
to war with your company in an election year. To me, the politics in America is
now about the culture war entirely. There is no solving it for any CEO and he
just has to deal with it. That might limit his market, but it probably won’t
because they are Disney and they are going to keep making MCU movies. I think
it’s safe to bracket that. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Let’s talk about what you described as “becoming a tech
company.” I hear that — and I think it is great for these companies to describe
themselves as tech companies — but what they are really describing is
distribution via apps on smart TV platforms. They are not talking about tech in
any other sense, like putting out mobile phones; they are talking about having
an app that is going to become their distribution platform and change the
business. Is there something I’m missing there or is that really it?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>No, that’s it. When we look at the way Disney wants to
bring itself into this tech equation and the way that Netflix started off as a
tech company — and now feels very much like a media entertainment company —
this is a debate that every CEO hates. You ask, “What are you? Are you a tech
company or are you a media company?” They will just say, “Hopefully we are a
profitable company.” <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>It is much more difficult for Disney to make that move
because it has been operating very similarly for decades. There is this issue
of control of the budget and green-lighting being funneled up to one person who
was never in any of these processes, but is Bob Chapek’s right-hand man.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>This is a lesson that was actually going to be
implemented under Bob Iger. When Iger spoke to Robert Kyncl — who I believe is
still a chief business officer over at YouTube and used to be at Netflix for
many years — he basically told them, “You can’t have your content team and your
distribution team on the same team. It just does not work. You are going to run
into too many issues and too many delays. Instead, you have to funnel it up and
split it off.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>There is some reporting that came out of CNBC that Iger
was thinking about doing Disney Plus, so he went and talked to Kyncl, who as
you said, is the chief business officer at YouTube and previously Netflix.
Kyncl’s advice to Bob Iger was, “You have a team that makes the movies, the
content, and then you have a team that runs your app, and they cannot be the
same team.” The way you just said it seems to now be received wisdom in the
industry; you said it as though it is obvious. It is not obvious to me. Why do
those have to be different teams?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I also don’t understand why. If you have one person in
charge of making a decision for the platform, you don’t have to run into all
this red tape about who is going to greenlight what for each different network.
There was a big issue that came out when Kevin Mayer, who oversaw a bunch of
the acquisitions at Disney — who went to TikTok for a little bit, and now has
his own company under Blackstone — was overseeing Disney Plus. He could take a
show and say “I’m greenlighting this and it is going to Disney Plus, so I am in
control of it.” But then you would have different executives like Peter Rice,
who is a very senior executive at Disney overseeing their TV division, who
would say, “Well, I am going to greenlight it, and I want it for ABC.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>By saying, “This person is going to decide where the show
goes, and you just have to make the show,” that takes away a lot of control
from a lot of executives. Specifically in the Disney company, Peter Rice and
John Landgraf — who oversees FX — really like that control; they like being
able to say, “I am going to greenlight this, and it is specifically going to go
to FX,” or, “It is going to go to ABC and I am going to be in control of
everything from the budget to the production.” Instead Disney is now saying,
“You get to create the show and you can greenlight it, but Kareem Daniel is
going to decide where it goes.” <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>He is going to decide if this is a Hulu show, an FX show,
or a Disney Plus show. I think what this gets you within the entertainment
industry is a lot of bruised egos, and a lot of trying to figure out what your
role is within your own team, within your own vertical, and within the greater
company itself. This was something that did not exist at Disney before; every
person who oversaw their own division had complete P&amp;L control, which was
everything from creative to budget. That is now basically stripped from them
because Bob Chapek, and Bob Iger as well, said, “We want to be able to focus on
streaming. We want to be able to focus on Disney Plus, and we want to be able
to have people in charge who can say, no, I’m taking this. It’s going here.
This is our future.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>“At the end of the day, every Decoder episode is about
org charts.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>..At the end of the day, every Decoder episode is about
org charts. This is a real theme of our show. We are now into the org chart of
Disney and the trade-offs it contains, so let’s apply that to Pixar. The idea
that Pixar is going to become a direct-to-video animation business is a meme. I
don’t know if it is a totally fair meme because Pixar movies are still all very
good, but the last three movies have skipped theatrical release. They go
straight to Disney Plus, which causes some tension because the theater is still
seen as the most auspicious place to release a movie. The problem is that
people are not going to movie theaters. How does that play out?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The long question was always, “are theaters necessary for
franchise making,” which is a very big deal to Disney. Arguably the biggest
deal to the biggest company is, “Can we make a franchise out of it? We operate
a flywheel effect, so if we can sell a bunch of Encanto merch or get a kid to
go to an Encanto food stand in Disney World, then they will watch Encanto 2. We
are now thriving because we have a whole self-fulfilling prophecy.” To
understand the Pixar equation, I think we really need to break down some very
quick Disney Plus facts. Disney Plus currently has 130 million subscribers
globally, but 43 million in the US. ARPU is about $6.68 in the US, which is
pretty good.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>ARPU is average revenue per user.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Yes, average revenue per user is about $6.68 in the US.
It is up about 15% year over year, and churn — which is how many customers they
are losing — is relatively low at about 3.7%. The industry average is about 5%;
the only company with lower churn than Disney Plus is Netflix. With that said,
when we look at Pixar and the question of if families are still going to
theaters and if family entertainment underperforming — which it was as of a few
months ago — Disney says, “We have these movies that we know will engage kids.
We are pretty sure families will sign up for the service if they have not
already, and we could possibly get some new fans out of it. If we move it to
Disney Plus, we can track the engagement and we can see if we can build
franchises out of this.” Bob Chapek has said this many times on earnings calls,
where he refers to a lot of it as experimentation. They are trying to figure
out what makes sense in the market. Do you go to theaters for 30 to 45 days,
then go to Disney Plus? Or do you go directly to Disney Plus?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>So the thing that he points to over and over again is
Encanto, where he says, “Encanto did just under $100 million in theaters, and
then it went to Disney Plus and it skyrocketed. It was the most watched movie
and it hit number one on the iTunes charts. There is an audience for kids and
for adults on Disney Plus if we move our movies here.” <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>So with Pixar, and especially the three Pixar films that
this happened to — which was Soul in December 2020, Luca in June of 2021, and
then most recently, Turning Red last month — none of those movies are based on
preexisting IP. I do not necessarily have to go to a theater to see those
movies. All of them are more likely to find a bigger audience on Disney Plus
during the pandemic.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>When we look at what is happening with Pixar, it is the
most understandable, justifiable business move for the company. The issue,
which speaks to this overall miscommunication issue that I think Bob Chapek is
currently figuring out, is what this communicates to people inside and outside
the company. Pixar, an Academy Award-winning division that Bob Iger spent many,
many months rebuilding a relationship with Steve Jobs to acquire in 2006, is
now being seen as the direct-to-video, bargain-bin studio. That is upsetting to
people at Pixar and to fans of Pixar. That is very questionable to people who
study the industry who are saying, “If Pixar movies can’t go to theaters, what
does that say for any other type of movie that people are trying to make in the
kids’ entertainment space?”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The move that Disney is making is the exact same move
that Netflix is experimenting with. Netflix decided two to three years ago that
they were going to produce six animated kids’ films a year, which was more than
Disney Animation at the time. They said, “We think there is room for franchise
growth and franchise building in the kids’ space on streaming.” Netflix decided
to take that opportunity and try it, but has not seen too much success with it.
Their biggest kids’ movie came from Sony, and that is The Mitchells vs. the
Machines, which they acquired from Sony and their partnership with the company.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>But Disney is now saying, “We have empirical data showing
that we can actually build franchises and it is going to save us a ton of money
on marketing and on printing. It can go directly here and we can collect credit
card data and watch how our users are doing this, and it actually provides us
more information about how we can market theme park passes, cruise tickets, and
so on.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I think the bigger issue with all of that is that he
forgets the creatives. At Disney, even if you are moving into this moment of,
“We are a streaming company,” you should tell the street over and over again,
“It is fine that we are losing money in theaters because we are a streaming
company, and that is where our focus is.” You have to communicate better with
the actual team members and the creatives who are building this product that
you are going to build an entire franchise around. That is where Bob Iger had a
lot of emotional intelligence to work with creatives and to have these
conversations. Something like moving Turning Red to Disney Plus under Iger
would have taken months and it would have had discussions with almost everyone,
which makes them feel included. It’s another benefit.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Under Chapek — who is much more operational —
streamlining it takes three weeks. He talks to the Pixar team and says, “This
makes sense for us. We are going to move it, and we are going to figure it
out.” That disconnect is really the core issue of what is happening with
Disney.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I get that the theater is still fancy and people want to
go to the theater, but if you just look at Encanto<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>— this is now an absolute sensation, every
song on the soundtrack is going to number one. I literally hear the words,
“Time for dinner,” just ringing through my head from “We Don’t Talk About
Bruno” because my kid is constantly watching this movie. Every parent I know is
just surrounded and inundated by this movie that would not have been the hit it
was if it had languished in the theaters. This is because of streaming. You
said at the beginning that you can measure affinity in different ways at
Parrot. Do you see that bump? Do you see that because this went to streaming,
the social media phenomenon behind Encanto has made it a different kind of hit?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Absolutely. We saw exponential growth in demand the
second it hit Disney Plus, but the demand for it was pretty average when it
came out in theaters. It was what you would expect to see from a Disney
Animation movie, but you expect to see a little bit more from Pixar. The minute
it hit Disney Plus, it sat at number two globally, behind only Spider-Man: No
Way Home for eight or nine days. Then the song “We Don’t Talk About Bruno”
became more of a meme, and more of a fascination with people; it became an absolute
seller and continued to take off. Disney’s argument is that this can happen for
every movie. Theatrical defenders will say, “It’s only one example, and there
is not enough data to really show if this is the move in consumer behavior, or
if this is just a one-time deal.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>We get a lot of debates happening because analysts point
to theatrical attendance per capita declining over the last 20 years, which is
true. Attendance for certain films, which tend to be superheroes, sequels, and
scaries — I call them the three S’s — tend to increase. What that means is
people are going to theaters less, but they are going to see more of a certain
type of movie.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The argument from the other side is that if studios
remove 30% of their theatrical releases to move to streaming — which is what a
lot of these companies are doing — how can you take the opportunity to see if
people will actually return to those movies if “superhero fatigue,” which isn’t
really proven, kicks in? This is an ongoing debate for companies like Disney,
Paramount, or Universal, who have these streaming services. It makes sense from
their company’s bottom line business perspective to move to streaming services
and to have their best films available there as quickly as possible to bring
more customers in and keep them there.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The argument from the creative side is that they still
believe the only way to make franchises is in theaters. You need to have the 45
days to give people a chance to see it, then go to the secondary window with
DVD, Blu-ray, iTunes, and then you go to streaming from there. We do see, from
a data perspective, that there is longer-term demand if it goes the more
traditional route, but certain movies are just naturally going to perform
better on streaming. They are going to be more valuable to a company via streaming
than they are in a crowded theatrical marketplace, which is what we are getting
back to.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I think with the Encanto argument, it was proof that if
the movie is good, people will find it. If it is available online, it becomes
much easier to create earned media around it, and that was a big part of the
Encanto success story. The question for Pixar, Disney Animation, and everyone
else is, “If we lose that theatrical placement — if the theaters just become
Morbius and Spider-Man — what does that mean for the future of our
entertainment? How does that affect our value?” <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Again, that comes back to the miscommunication sector
where this is something a CEO with really strong emotional intelligence, like
Iger, would have many conversations about to try to figure out how to make
everyone happy — shareholders, consumers, and employees. I think Bob Chapek is
much more focused on shareholders and consumers.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I have a million more questions I could ask about Disney,
but we are running out of time. Let’s talk about the other giant that is
undergoing massive change: WarnerMedia. I feel like if we have any crossover
listeners from The Vergecast to Decoder, you will know that Julia and I spent
hours of our lives talking about WarnerMedia with each other. The quick summary
is that AT&amp;T bought WarnerMedia, then called Time Warner, for $85 billion.
There was sort of an immediate culture clash because the phone company had
bought the Hollywood studio. A bunch of people left, and there were many
layoffs. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Eventually, they did launch HBO Max. They brought in
Jason Kilar, who is the CEO of WarnerMedia, and very much a tech person. He got
in the same kind of talent fights during the pandemic because he moved all of
Warner’s theatrical releases to HBO Max. There was just nonstop chaos. AT&amp;T
gets a new CEO — who is actually the guy who bought WarnerMedia, John Stankey —
and his first decision as CEO is to spin off all the stuff he was in charge of
buying, including DirecTV, and now he is selling WarnerMedia for $43 billion.
So AT&amp;T bought this thing for $85 million, and now they are selling it for
$43 million. What happened there?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>That is a good question. The initial thought from John
Stankey and the AT&amp;T team was that if they could vertically integrate
WarnerMedia into their division, they could use WarnerMedia to sell better
phone plans. The idea was always to supplement the core product. This is a
conversation I have with many of my clients, which is, “What is your core
product that you were trying to build around with the introduction of a
direct-to-consumer platform? What is this thing you’re trying to do?” <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>AT&amp;T thought, “If we have WarnerMedia, this will help
us in the same way that Comcast and NBCUniversal worked as a company in 2011,
when they merged and are still together.” It did not go as great as expected.
It turns out that if you offer HBO Max on an assortment of platforms, people
will not necessarily watch it on their phone via AT&amp;T Wireless. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>So now WarnerMedia is merging with Discovery, which has
split people on whether it is a good or bad idea. I think it makes the most
sense for those two companies as they are perfectly complementary to each
other; HBO Max tends to skew a little bit older and much more male, while
Discovery is a little bit older, but much more female. The reality programming
of Discovery can become younger if they focus on those creative pursuits, and
HBO Max can figure out a way to go a little bit younger with the animation side
that they are trying to get into. If you combine those things, what you
effectively have is cable light. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>It’s basically like saying, “Here is where you can get
all of your favorite entertainment, and we are going to maybe do a little bit
of sports here.” This is a conversation that David Zaslav, the CEO of
Discovery, will have with his team. Jason Kilar, CEO of WarnerMedia, famously
said he did not want sports on the platform. Sports on TNT, which they also
own, is a very big deal to him and the company at large, but Zaslav seems much
more inclined to say, “We’re going to bring sports onto the platform.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>So you have got a little bit of sports, you have a little
bit of news, via CNN Plus, which just launched. I am sure that will roll into
whatever platform that they launch, which will be Discovery plus HBO Max and
CNN Plus. So you have news, sports, and a lot of different entertainment. The
question that comes out of this is, “What do you price it at? At what point are
you just recreating cable, but in a much more fragmented and almost annoying
way?”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I realized I never asked you about CNN Plus, which
WarnerMedia just launched. There is obviously a lot of drama at CNN. Jeff
Zucker was forced out of the company and there was lots of scandal, but they
went ahead and launched a streaming service anyway. It is a weird one, because
it is not its own app. It is like a tab in the existing CNN app; it seems a
little confused. What do you think is going on there?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>It is the type of app that gets launched for what we
would refer to as super fans. ESPN Plus would be comparable. It is for a
specific type of person who is interested in what I refer to as infotainment.
It is Anthony Bourdain, it is documentaries, it is daily shows from the CNN
hosts that are not about CNN. When we use the term plus for CNN, you would
assume you get CNN and then some, but it is CNN minus.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>You do not get CNN, and you do not really have live
programming. You do not have access to the type of journalism that people turn
to CNN for when there is a war or when there is a pandemic, when they want to
get first up-to-the-minute news. What we will see happen with CNN Plus, I am
positive, is it will exist for maybe about a year or so, and then it will be
thrown into the inevitable HBO Max, Discovery Plus, CNN bundle. It will not be
a net loss for WarnerMedia, but they will just invest in it as part of
additional content to the overarching bundle. It is not going to be its own
standalone product and it is not going to be a big thing that they are talking
about. I mentioned on Twitter at one point that it seemed like a way to retain
talent<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>as the talent wars are heating up
— when all of the different anchors are being talked to by all the different
big companies to take on different roles and be the face of all these streaming
services.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Someone at CNN told me that they felt it was the exact
same thing, and that is how many of the talent felt. They were being given the
opportunity to do new shows on CNN Plus that they could not do on CNN because
there is a fixed schedule and a fixed type of audience. That’s great. That
works better as part of supplementary news. News is additive. It is a
heartbeat, but it is not what CNN Plus is. It is a very confusing product that
does not make a lot of sense, but will within a bigger bundle.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>So what would make it make sense is CNN?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Right. The reason that CNN Plus cannot carry CNN coverage
is because of the affiliate revenue that they make from CNN and all the rights
agreements that they have with advertisers. They cannot bring it to CNN Plus
because it would be a whole headache for them. Until they figure out that
situation, CNN Plus is basically just documentaries and reality programming.
They can give it the CNN logo, and that is what they did at HBO Max. They just
had CNN programming and added a CNN block to it, and that is what it should be
within a larger bundle. The idea of CNN Plus without news does not make any
sense to me.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I actually still do not know the difference between an
HBO show and an HBO Max show. They are labeled differently in the app, and I’m
like, “I don’t know. Does that mean one is worse?” I think CNN Plus has the
same problem.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I always think of my mom in these situations. Would she
care about the difference between HBO and HBO Max show? She wouldn’t. A lot of
people don’t. A lot of people watched Station Eleven and think it was an HBO
show, and then they figure it’s an HBO Max show. People watched Euphoria and
thought it was an HBO Max series, and it was an HBO show.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>This is only important to the executives who oversee
them, and they are like, “That is an HBO show, which is very different from HBO
Max,” but I think for the general consumer, the inherent value of just having
all of that programming is better than trying to figure out who it belongs to.
Eventually it becomes, “FX shows are on Hulu, and so I assume HBO shows are on
HBO Max.” As long as customers are paying, the top CEOs and COOs don’t really
care whether it’s HBO or HBO Max. It is all being streamed.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>It is super annoying, especially because they won’t allow
the Apples, the Rokus, and the Amazons of the world to build an interface on
top of all these apps. Some of them will, some of them will not, and you’re
still jumping between apps.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I think we are getting back to things feeling really
bloated. When streaming was first coming out, the promise of it was this idea
of à la carte that you could not get via cable. It has been so long since I had
cable that I don’t know how much it costs these days, but you would pay for the
whole suite and it would be easy. There were a lot of things in one specific
setting, but it is bloated; you have 500 channels and you are using maybe 40 of
them. It just didn’t feel good, and you could not get out of it. Trying to call
a cable company to do anything with your plan was a tedious affair as well. So
with streaming, and especially with Netflix, it was this idea of, “Hey, you can
just pay ten bucks a month and you are going to get a bunch of different things,
but you really control what you want. You are choosing to buy into it and it is
your choice.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Now with the consolidation happening and the
conglomerates coming back in, they are basically saying, “Well, we have all
these different products that generate revenue and we want to bundle them in
some way,” whether that is by creating one platform that is an internal bundle,
or the Disney streaming services bundle aspect, where they are saying, “You pay
$14 or $15 and you get all three services, which is Hulu, ESPN Plus, Disney
Plus.” <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>That creates a really annoying, frustrating, and
disingenuous experience for consumers that almost makes you say, “I’m going to
go to fuboTV, YouTube TV, or Hulu with live TV and just pick up one of those
packages.” The only problem with that is that these companies are no longer
making good television for TV. They are saying, “If you want the really good
series that everyone is talking about, you have to subscribe to our streaming
services.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>That is where this moment of friction is going to happen,
where you have your live TV for sports fans mostly, who are basically saying,
“I’m going to subscribe because I want sports and news.” It is why Rupert
Murdoch kept Fox Sports Network and Fox News when he sold Disney. On the other
side of it, you have all these people who are saying, “I want to watch this
show. There are too many streaming services and I can’t get any of them through
a bundle if I get cable.” So it is not great right now for consumers; there are
parts of the landscape right now that are phenomenal, but it is getting really
complicated, bloated, and tedious again.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I am definitely paying more for television than I was
when I paid for every channel from Verizon Fios. Everybody thought I was nuts,
but I was like, “Well, I am just paying this one company for this bundle but
now I have every channel.” Now I’m paying for YouTube TV, HBO Max, Netflix, and
for a minute I had to pay for Discovery Plus because there was one documentary
that my wife wanted to watch. Then I had to set a reminder on my phone to
cancel it. That is where we are at; I am just actively turning on and off these
services.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>A combined WarnerMedia-Discovery might be cable light.
When we talk about tech companies and these apps, HBO Max is not well-known for
being a great app. When they talk about being a tech company, they are still
just talking about being an app. Owning your user journey — if you want to call
it that — when you load the app, you are going to load it because you want to
watch one thing. Then they are going to recommend another thing, then another
thing, and then they are going to market to you a third thing that you’ll watch
tomorrow. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>They control your experience the way that a cable company
used to control your experience on a cable box, but they do not seem that
invested in making those experiences great. Even Disney Plus is a fine app, but
I would not call it a great app. It just seems like Netflix — for all of its
various troubles, since the market is totally saturated and they are still
looking for growth through ads or games — still has the best app that does the
best job of showing you things you might want to watch.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>You hit the nail on the head. You know from my time at
The Verge — where I would complain to you many times about UI and UX on
streaming services — that it is an issue, and it is not necessarily getting
better. What happened is a lot of these companies came in after Netflix and
they realized, “Netflix is making money on our content; we would like to own
our content on our own platform. We would like to own that customer
relationship, especially if we have other products.” <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Companies like Comcast and Disney have other things going
on, so it makes sense. The issue is that they were content suppliers. They
said, “We will supply the content. We will make it, and the carriers will carry
it to people.” Now they have to own both routes; not only are they the content
suppliers, but they are carrying it to people. If they do not carry it well, if
the distribution does not work well, people will notice, they will tweet, and
they will say things. It becomes a whole issue for the companies.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I will tweet any time a streaming app is bad.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I literally started a hashtag for people to use to
express their frustrations with UI and UX on streaming platforms because it is
such an ongoing issue that is so noticeable. My prediction is that the tech
will not necessarily get better; it will be usable and people will pay for it
because they want the content and they will just deal with it. Going forward,
that is going to become much more of an issue when these companies look at the
potential loss revenue that they are getting from password sharing, from
monthly churn. Eventually you just start seeing things slowly creep up towards
cable.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Content budgets get more expensive so they have to
increase prices yearly in order to continue paying for the content, make
revenue, and appease the street. They go into annual lock-ins because they do
not want people churning every month. They prevent you from sharing passwords
in a way that has not been seen up to this point in the streaming space. Then
eventually — once the households with cable drop below 50 million — it becomes
a moment where a lot of these companies can say, “Okay, do we shift our sports
focus and our news focus directly to streaming?” At that point, when we look at
the incremental cost that creates, you get to cable. You just recreate cable,
but in a much more fragmented space where they get to control the customer
relationship.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I think that is the moment everyone is waiting for. It is
a fun balance game of, “Do I go back to cable where things are, but there is no
good television anymore? Or do I just wait for this next evolution, where
eventually I will pay for up to three different streaming services — basically
three cable packages that have everything I need — but I’m not happy?”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The unspoken player at this moment is Amazon, who says,
“Hey, part of the reason we work as a company is because a lot of these
industries became much more fragmented and terrible to navigate, and we can
offer things as one package. We will come in and underprice certain things; we
have good TV, and we are going to have a bunch of sports like baseball and
football. You are also going to be able to shop, stream Twitch, listen to
music, or whatever else you want to do with it.” That is the package that I think
more people will gravitate towards. If I am going to pay you for a bunch of
this stuff, what else do I get with it?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I like that the theory for Amazon is that they are really
good at predatory pricing. We will see how long that lasts. Although their
merger with MGM did get approved by the various regulatory authorities. My
favorite line was when the European Union approved it and said, “Well, MGM is
not must-have programming, so you can have it,” which is a harsh burn from the
Europeans. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Let’s talk about sports. It is the piece of the bundle
that you cannot really disrupt into on-demand. A lot of sports are live, and
people are going to pay for it. The gambling industry that is now legal across
the country is exploding. There is a lot of money and attention on live sports.
If you have live sports and the stuff people want, they are going to subscribe
to your service. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Amazon has Thursday night football for the next 11 years,
and they’ve got some baseball. Apple TV Plus is going to have Friday night
baseball. There are constant rumors that Disney will spin off ESPN, but why
would they? They have had to reinvent ESPN 9,000 times. Julie and I are both
football fans. We text each other about football a lot. All the football
announcers just got huge new deals to go to different services and platforms
because the money is insane. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>What is going on with sports? Are people just buying and
selling the rights so they can add subscribers? Is this a real business that is
going to make sense? Where do you see it landing?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Sports was important to linears because it was the
easiest way to bring in new customers; people will seek out their favorite
teams. Fanatics will seek out every version of a game that they can, so sports
became the foundation for a lot of these cable networks and broadcasts. It
still works. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>We are looking at the leagues saying, “We don’t know
where we are going to generate the most revenue and we are open to new
discussions.” When the NFL is saying, “We have different games and different
packages that we can sell.” Amazon — which is worth more money than God three
times over — says they are going to bid as much as they need on something and
the other companies just can’t, but it is just a dime in the bucket for them.
It is the same for Apple. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>It becomes a really great place, especially for leagues
like the MLB, which has viewership issues but still an audience. If you are the
league, you know you can get more money out of Amazon and Apple than you can
out of the broadcasters, for the most part. You still want to be in most homes
and bars because that is still important to you. You still do not trust their
tech delivery and should still be concerned about lag. You do not want to
alienate viewers. But you’re at a point where you say, “We want to experiment
so we are going to give you some of these deals.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>If you’re Apple and Amazon, you’re saying, “We would like
to experiment and see if this is a business opportunity for us. We are going to
buy into a low-stakes league, like baseball. We are going to see if there is an
audience for sports and if this is something that we want in our package.” What
Apple TV Plus does for the services sector — from Apple to the Apple One
Bundle, and then to a larger extent Apple’s core product of hardware keeping
people within that ecosystem — is still relatively unclear.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Can I tell you my theory? Apple services revenue is
almost entirely in-app purchases and video games. That isn’t fancy. They make
TV shows so that when they talk about services they can show pictures of
celebrities like Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. I don’t know what that
business is, it is not broken out so we can’t tell, but we do know that most of
the revenue is in-app purchases and video games.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>That is exactly it though. When we look at Apple and
Amazon, we talk about them as major competitors in the ad-spot space, because
they are major competitors no matter what space they want to be in. They are
huge companies, but they have never broken out what Amazon Prime Video or Apple
TV Plus actually do for their companies. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The last time we heard about Amazon Prime Video, Jeff
Bezos was still CEO and he said, “Out of 175 million subscribers, everyone has
watched at least one movie.” I was like, “I hope that they are watching at
least one movie!” If the theory is that Amazon Prime Video is a way to sell
additional retail products, sure, but also reduces churn for Amazon Prime? That
has never actually been proven by the company in any meaningful public way, so
it is hard to really state that. The continued bet on sports from Amazon
without that information is interesting because clearly there is something that
Amazon is seeing from the sports package, whether it is advertising, additional
retail purchases when people come to watch it, or lower churn. The fact that
they are continuously invested in different leagues seems to signify that there
is some success there. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I do think that sports, as I have been saying, are going
to be more fragmented, more difficult to navigate, and much more annoying for
fans. With the most recent Amazon deal, they are going to host 21 Yankee games
exclusively, which means that if you use Yes Network in the tri-state area, you
cannot watch it. You have to go to Amazon to watch these games. That gets
really annoying for people who essentially are going to have to use a service
like JustWatch to find out where their game is.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>It just sounds like sports is going to get more
fragmented.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>By a large amount. It is getting more fragmented at the
major level, the national level, and then it is also getting more fragmented
within the actual RSN space, in the regional sports network space. Bally, who
owns a bunch of different regional sports networks, was going to launch its own
app. You would pay basically $20 to $30 to them to get some access to some
regional sports, and you would still need ESPN, NBC, or CVS for something like
Monday Night Football. If you are trying to cut the cord entirely, you could go
to Peacock or Paramount Plus. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>You end up paying more for arguably less of what you were
actually getting within cable. The theory is that these companies are just
waiting for pay TV households to drop below 45 to 50 million — which is
eventually going to happen — so they can start saying, “Let’s migrate
everything to streaming and the leagues will get behind them.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>My biggest frustration with sports streaming right now is
that over-the-air antennas look better for sports than any app that I can
currently subscribe to. Sports look bad on YouTube TV, they look bad on the Fox
Sports app, and they look bad on Amazon. Then if you’re in a major city, you
can just put up an antenna and get the broadcast, and they look great. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I understand that there is a huge business dynamic
happening where you can say, “Okay, we have bled this stone dry, and now we are
going to migrate everyone over to streaming.” It seems like the lack of
emphasis on the product itself is the actual biggest problem. If you told me,
“Okay, you can get NFL Sunday Ticket, and all the games will look the best they
can in 4K,” then I would pay almost any amount of money for that product, but
no one will sell that to me right now.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>No, it is a diminishing product. My own household was
working with the Google Chromecast with TV and the 4K was not great, so I
upgraded to the new Apple TV. The 4K looks great on television in terms of with
TV shows and movies, but it is still not doing great with the sports when you
run YouTube TV through the Apple set box. The situation with that is you end up
going to a bar and you’re like, “I’m just going to go watch this here, or I’m
going to go to a friend’s house who has cable,” and you’re still spending more
money on it. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The idea seems to be, “We do not necessarily need to
worry about how this looks because we have the content exclusively, so people
will have to come to us regardless.” Almost like you are taking people hostage
in this situation where I’m going to pay because I want to watch the game.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The lack of focus on the actual tech side of things — on
the visuals of having a nice quality game — leaves room in there for
competitors to come in and say, “We are going to focus really strongly on this;
we are going to figure out the right situations and build our way up that way.”
<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>“Disney could invest into the tech side of ESPN to try to
make it more of a better experience, but we do not see any actual investment
being made here.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Disney could invest into the tech side of ESPN to try to
make it more of a better experience, but we do not see any actual investment
being made here. This is a conversation I have with friends in the industry who
work at these companies, and it’s always, “Well, we have the money for it and
we could invest more, but we are investing everything into content rights and
acquisition.” All the rest of it gets left on the side because they just assume
people will show up.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Is that because all the deals are exclusive? I could
compare that to music, for example. The music industry moved to streaming, and
there was a huge rush of exclusives where everyone realized, “Oh, this is
horrible.” If you are in Apple Music and you get the exclusives then that’s
great, but if the exclusives are on Spotify then that’s horrible. The artists
hated it because their audiences were getting diminished; they did not like
being used as marketing for services in that way. Everything is everywhere now,
like Apple competes with spatial audio, or Tidal has the highest quality, or
Amazon has its own version of both of those things. At least there is market
differentiation in quality because there are no exclusives. It sounds like the
opposite in streaming, where there are all kinds of exclusives, so there is
really no emphasis on how sports look.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Well, sports fundamentally gets into the situation where
if you are going to try to pirate a game — if you are going to try and look for
a live feed of the game — it is by no means impossible. Google has taken
measures to make it more difficult, but it is still relatively easy; it shows
up on the fourth page of Google. There’s just a link that’s like, “Watch this
game live.” The quality is not great, but if someone really just wants to watch
that game, it takes an effort, but they can do it. With music, it is relatively
simple to download an album from somewhere or to have someone send you the
links; it is not necessarily a big hurdle. With the games, it still feels like
a challenge. Even if you can still find it on Google, there is still this
challenge to get really good quality live streaming with the game. They know
that you are only going to get one Packers versus Vikings game and that is
going to be on a Monday.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I use those teams for a reason. They know that the fans
are going to come out and find a way to watch this game, and they are going to
pay for a way to do it. They know that they can own that relationship, that
there is only one route to go through. With music, they have to find different
ways to differentiate themselves, so it becomes all about the quality of what
you are streaming, but it is much easier to go around the hurdles to get that
album.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>To your point about diminishing the audience for artists,
that is a bigger deal when artists are like, “Hey, we want you to listen to our
music so we can get the most people who come out to our concerts and buy our
T-shirts.” With the NFL, they want the most people to watch their games as
well, but they are pretty guaranteed that if Rodgers signs for the Packers for
another four years, they will sell more jerseys. People are still going to go
to those games and they are still going to be able to sell Monday Night
Football or Thursday Night Football at the highest price to the highest bidder.
They sell exclusivity because there is still real value in that.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Julia’s just trolling me with Packers references; that’s
all that’s happening here. That brings me to my last big overall question. Here
is the shape of the industry. You have got the big legacy players like Disney
and WarnerMedia trying to shift their businesses — reorg them into being
streaming-first platforms — expressed as an app. You have got newer players
like Apple and Amazon — who are buying movies and winning Oscars — expressed as
an app. You have got the future of live sports expressed as God-knows-how-many
apps.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Why aren’t the apps better? I know we talked about it a
little bit earlier, but it just seems like this is the first point of
differentiation. You are saying the entire future of your business is in this
screen. Why is there so little emphasis on this screen being easier to use? The
tech aspect of how this works should be top-of-the-line. Do they feel the
competitive pressure or is it just, “Hey, we can get you in with a buzzy new
show and then keep you with a catalog, that is the business and the app is just
table stakes?”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>There is a very specific reason Netflix has two
headquarters, and one is in Silicon valley and one is in LA. There is an idea
at Netflix that is the basis of their company: You cannot have the creativity
without the tech distribution and the powerful tech arm to help provide a great
experience, to make people want to stay within that app, and to make people
want to use it. That is what gives Netflix a major advantage over its
competitors. There is a reason why a lot of these Hollywood companies are not in
Silicon Valley; they are working out of Burbank or New York and are
hyperfocusing their streaming. The oversight team and the executive team are
working with creative development and creative executives. Their creative focus
is inherently on the product, and their investment focus is inherently on,
“Let’s have the best rights; let’s spend $100 million on getting the J. J.
Abrams show, because if we don’t, it will go to someone else.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Over the weekend, millions of DirecTV customers saw
channels like ABC and ESPN go dark, limiting access to the U.S. Open and the
start of college football season and more. Well, those channels are still dark
because of a contract dispute with Disney, which pulled its platforms from
DirecTV's services, all this is affecting more than 11 million customers. NPR
TV critic Eric Deggans was on a call with DirecTV officials this morning. He
joins me now. Hey there.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: Hi.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>KELLY: Hi - sounds like there are a whole lot of grumpy
sports fans out there. Why...<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>DEGGANS: That's one way to put it.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>KELLY: ...Is this disruption happening right now?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>DEGGANS: Well, as with so many things in media, it is all
about the Benjamins. You know, it's all about money. So more specifically, it's
about how two different companies are dealing with businesses that are
declining. Like, viewers are spending less time with traditional broadcasters,
cable channels, satellite services. And they're cutting the cord with providers
like DirecTV because they worry that they're paying too much for too many
channels that they're not watching. Now, Disney, on the other hand, benefits
when providers like DirecTV carry all their channels even if a customer might
only want the bigger ones like, say, ESPN. So this is the heart of what makes
cable and satellite TV work. You use the popularity of big channels to help pay
for the smaller channels that might have smaller audiences.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>KELLY: Tell us more about this call today. There were
journalists, obviously, like you on there, also business analysts. What did
DirecTV officials actually have to say?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>DEGGANS: Well, DirecTV CFO Ray Carpenter did not hold
back in criticizing Disney. He accused the company of charging more for linear
broadcast and cable channels despite shrinking viewership and accused them of
shifting financial resources to their streaming services like Disney+ and Hulu.
Now, according to the CFO, DirecTV's major issue is getting the flexibility to
offer customers these skinny bundles, they call them, that gather together a
smaller group of channels grouped by genre - like, say, sports or kids' TV - so
that consumers can pare down the number of channels that they're paying for.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>KELLY: OK. Well, is Disney sounding remotely receptive to
this?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>DEGGANS: Well, I haven't yet heard directly from Disney
about what DirecTV said today, but Disney released a statement on Sunday that
said in part, quote, &quot;while we're open to offering DirecTV flexibility in
terms which we've extended to other distributors, we will not enter into an
agreement that undervalues our portfolio of television channels and
programs.&quot; Now, they've created a website called keepmynetworks.com to
explain their side of the story for customers. And you might remember that Disney
got into a similar dispute with the company Charter Communications last year
that saw over two dozen Disney-owned channels yanked from that service for more
than 10 days.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>KELLY: OK. Well, there's an urgency to this dispute. I
live with a couple of teenagers who were glued to the start of college football
or trying to be. What is your sense of timing? When might this dispute be
resolved?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>DEGGANS: Well, you know, DirecTV CFO Carpenter - he said
the company would battle for, quote, &quot;as long as it needs to,&quot; end
quote. But, you know, costs will increase on both sides as this important
programming like college football in the NFL rolls out. I mean, DirectTV has
created its own website. It's called unbundledisney.com. They lay out their
arguments. They're also offering a $20 fee credit to some customers.
Ironically, because it's so easy to start using a streaming service, some of those
consumers can probably sign up for platforms like YouTube TV or the
Disney-owned Hulu Plus Live TV to see some of the channels that went dark. Now,
consumers of cable and satellite TV services - they're going to have to expect
to see more of these fights in the future. And ultimately, I think it's going
to lead to a system where there's fewer channels offered on cable and satellite
systems both to keep the cost down and also to make it easier for customers to
sort through all this content.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Hello and welcome to decoder. I'm Neli Patel Editor in
Chief of The. Verge. And Decoder is my show about big ideas and other problems.
Today I'm talking with Matt Strauss, who is chairman of Direct to Consumer at N
NBC Universal. That's a fancy title. It means he's in charge of Peacock and all
of NBC universal's, other consumer products that includes everything from
Fandango and its Fandango at Home Video service, which used to be voodoo to
Rotten Tomatoes, to the core platforms that powers the now TV service run by
Sky in Europe. That's a lot. And all of that is under the overall ownership of
Comcast, which is in the middle of its own massive transition as the
traditional cable TV business fades away. Matt actually spent almost two
decades at Comcast proper working on its cable products before switching over
to NBCU.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (1m 49s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And I was really interested in his view and how the
economics of the TV business will shake out as almost everyone moves over to
streaming, Matt also oversees what's called the Global streaming platform,
which Peacock and other services at Comcast run on. And I wanted to know if
that big tech investment is generating the kind of economies of scale that
really pay off over time. Stuff that tech companies think about all the time,
but which media companies have had to learn. And one thing that I really wanted
to talk to Matt about was how Peacock handled the Olympics this year. It really
felt like things clicked for that platform in Peacock in Paris over the summer.
And the idea that all of the coverage from the Olympics could be served up in
multiple different formats on demand and live really came together.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (2m 31s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>It turns out that a lot of these ideas have been brewing
inside of NBC for a long time, for a decade or more in some cases. And you'll
hear Matt describe how some early efforts didn't really go so well. There's a
lot going on in this one tech media sports culture all at once. It's quite a
ride. Our usual disclosure before we start NBCU is an investor in the Virgins
parent company, Vox Media, but they have no control over our newsroom and I
remain free to demand NFL Games and 4K HDR whatever I want. You're on the hook
now, Matt. Okay. Matt Strauss, head of Direct to Consumer at NBC Universal.

maybe just to give you a little bit of, of, of background, I, I actually had
just celebrated my 20 year anniversary at Comcast and so I've been at the
company for quite a long time. When I came to Comcast, I actually came there as
cable was transitioning from analog to digital and it gave way to the two-way
connectivity that ultimately built things like on demand and so on-demand
technology is something I've been very passionate about my entire career and
was really focused on how I build that out for Comcast and spent quite a number
of years doing that. And then we ultimately launched the X one platform, which
was Comcast's IP set top box because we realized that the future was on demand
that was gonna give people instant gratification and we needed a platform to
allow people ultimate control that they could navigate all these on-demand
choices.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And X one became the platform where we did that. And it
really was ahead of its time because it aggregated live and on demand and DVR
and even apps and made them all really seamless for consumers in including the
ability to navigate them with your voice, with the voice remote, which was
before even Siri and Alexa. Like we were experimenting with voice. And I think
as my career there kind of grew and I took on more of the role of overseeing
the residential services at Comcast, which included video and broadband and
phone. I got a call one day to come to NBC, which obviously is, is a subsidiary
of Comcast. And I got a call from Steve Burke who at the time was the CEO, you
know, he had asked if I would come there to help them build a streaming service
and take it to market.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (5m 20s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And I got that call on a Thursday and Monday I showed up
in New York City with my suitcase and I was, I was ready to go. And what's very
common inside of large companies in my experience is that, you know, when
you're trying to build something new, it's, it's common to almost incubate it.
You know, you kind of create resources, you put a little bit of a fence around
it because you don't want the day-to-day activity necessarily interfering with
the ambition of trying to build a new business. And, and Peacock was the same
inside of NBC, but what I realized early on was that there's lots of other
businesses within NBC that actually are very complimentary and can help get us
more scale, can help de-risk the execution and the ambition we had with
Peacock, for example, you know, NBC owns Fandango, which is one of the largest
ticketing companies.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (6m 5s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>You know, they own Voodoo, which is now called Fandango
at Home, which has, you know, a catalog of 250,000 titles for digital purchase
and rental. They own Rotten Tomatoes, which is certainly known for movie and TV
reviews. You know, they also, everyone's familiar with NBC and, and a lot of
the cable networks that we have in the United States, but NBC distributes their
networks in almost every country around the world. And so what we recognized
was that if we could aggregate all of these businesses under one portfolio, it
actually could give us even more, more economies of scale. And that's what we
started to do. And so the umbrella of direct to consumers, peacock is certainly
a big piece of it, but all these other businesses, the global businesses and
these other digital businesses now sit under this D two C umbrella and they're,
they each have their own individual p and ls, but in the aggregate, you know,
they reach a hundred million users, they generate billions of dollars of
revenue and they also, you know, they're available in over 70 countries around
the world.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (7m 5s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And so I, I think that that is the portfolio that I'm now
managing. And so how we then leverage that portfolio is something that I've
been trying to, you know, build out over the last few years around, you know,
again, trying to build one product team, one technol, one technology team, one
decision sciences research team, et cetera, to give us kind of these centers of
excellence inside of NVC as we continue to roll out, you know, our, our digital
plans for direct to consumer.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (7m 31s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Well you're on decoder, so I'm absolutely gonna ask you
about how all of that is structured and how all of those individual p and ls
fight for resources. But I want, I wanna just take one step back and focus on,
on the transition you mentioned from Comcast to NBC, to direct to consumer
broadly in the TV world, we're going from a place where big cable companies
like Comcast or Spectrum or whatever had big regional physical infrastructure
monopolies, right? You, you had these natural monopolies 'cause you had wires
in the ground going to everyone's houses, you were the distributor, the video
providers would come to you and you would resell those services and that was a
pretty good business for everyone.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (8m 14s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Now we're at a place where there's multiple ways to get
programming over the internet, whether it's wireless, whether it's fiber in the
ground, whether it's still the cable network, whether it's other forms of
broadband, starlink and the distributors don't have as much power over the
suppliers 'cause the suppliers can get to consumers in lots of different ways.
That's the transition that you're mentioning and it has really disrupted the
whole industry. H how do you see Peacock fitting into this at the end? Is it
gonna be as good of a business as the cable business was once upon a time?
'cause it feels like everyone is searching for a business that good.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (8m 48s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>There's no question, you know, that, you know, the cable
business is a good business. It continues to be a good business. I think to
answer the question question you, you almost need to look at it through the
lens of the consumer. What I've learned is there really are different cohorts
of how people consume video, how they subscribe to video. So for example, the
cable customer tends to watch a lot of tv. You know, the average consumer
watches about five hours a day. If you subscribe to cable, you know, you typically
watch that much if not more. And there's a lot of benefit of having cable
because as I mentioned, if you have the X one platform, there's a simplicity of
just having all the choices in one place. It works with like 99.99%
reliability.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (9m 31s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And in many cases people are also subscribing to the
bundle. So they're getting video but then they're also getting internet and in
some cases they're getting their wireless. And you know, the bundling, even
though people tend to say they like a la carte bundling has a lot of virtue
because the more you take the better the price. And so people who subscribe to
cable and satellite today, it's not that they're not aware of other choices
they're paying in some cases for that, for that convenience and that reliability.
They also tend to over index in subscribing to streaming services. And so it's
not one or the other. In many cases you're seeing, you know, that customer
buying both and so that's one part of the market. You have another part of the
market which might be more price sensitive, maybe does not consume as much
video in, in some cases, you know, they might watch video but they might be
spending more time on social media or or video gaming or, or how else they're
occupying their time and they like the flexibility of being able to subscribe
to a subset of services.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (10m 32s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And in many ways that's what direct to consumer is
offering. And so there is a Venn diagram though here where you know as a media
company you want to cast a broad enough net where you're providing a value
proposition for one segment, which is like the content carnivore, but at the
same time offering the optionality and in some cases with direct to consumer
and, but, but in many cases there's an overlap between the two. And so when you
look at it as a portfolio, which is really how we manage the business in MVC,
it's not direct to consumer sits outside of the broadcast and the cable
networks, it's actually all one group and we manage it as a portfolio and, and
there's examples where that comes to life like the Olympics.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (11m 14s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>But I think that, you know, we are kind of looking at it
in totality and that it's about giving customers choice and options and that's
how we see ourselves growing. And so if pay TV declines and cord cutting grows,
you know, we still wanna service the customers who have pay tv. But at the same
time we recognize that the growth over the next, you know, foreseeable future
is gonna continue to come from direct to consumer.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (11m 38s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Yeah, the last time I was a Comcast customer was 15 years
ago I lived in Chicago and everyone I knew was a Comcast customer, right? That
was the choice in my building and most of the neighborhoods that my friends
lived in. And then we all also got internet from Comcast. 'cause of what you're
describing, the bundle there was not another thing. It was just the easiest
next thing to do. When you describe direct to consumer, that's another
distribution method, right? You're going literally directly to consumer and
charging them money and then giving them services directly and you manage the
customer relationship. Is that the part that's gonna grow versus the experience
I had when I was a Comcast customer and I would watch NBC five in Chicago but
Comcast was owned the relationship with me,<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (12m 25s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>You know, when you kind of study the, the pay TV
ecosystem and kind of the trajectory of pay tv, I think it's consistently been
declining, you know, year over year and you know, I don't think anybody really
knows what, at what point does it kind of start to flatten out. But I do
believe that there's always gonna be a fairly large group of people who are
willing to pay a premium for cable for all the reasons that I said before. And
so I think that's still gonna be a very, very large part of tv of the TV viewing
and TV household viewing. But yes, I mean direct to consumer is where we're
really projecting the growth to come from. And, and certainly what's
interesting about what you're, you're putting your finger on is I, I actually
think that there's a lot of signs of what I've learned in the cable business
that I see happening in the direct-to-consumer business that in some ways it's
gonna be I think back to the future.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (13m 18s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And what I mean by that is that, you know, people who
maybe did cut the cord, part of the rationale I believe was because they
thought they were gonna save money by going and just getting some streaming
services. And to a certain extent that was true for some period of time, but it
was very predictable that, you know, the cost of content hasn't gone down, the
cost of sports rights haven't gone down. It was inevitable that prices of
streaming services were gonna have to increase. And we've seen that as an industry
over the past 18 to 24 months where streaming services have continued to take a
ra their rates up in an effort to drive more profitability.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (13m 59s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>By the way, we're not excluded from that. I mean we took
a price increase over the summer. And so I think that that though was a very
predictable outcome. The other predictable outcome from my point of view is
what I said earlier, which is people watch more video than they really know.
Like if you look at the Nielsen numbers, the amount of time that people spend
watching video has been fairly consistent over the past decade. And so if you
cut the cord and you sign up for a streaming service, you're unlikely gonna get
your video calories as a consumer from one service. And so what happens is you
subscribe to two three and now the average consumer is subscribing to four or
five services. And so you take these two things together where I'm subscribing
now to four or five services, the rates are continuing to go up.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (14m 46s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>In some cases you may be asking yourself like, wait, I
might be paying more and possibly getting less than what I got when I
subscribed to cable. And I think that these are the ingredients in the
marketplace that is driving the market to bundling. And I had talked about this
five years ago that we're likely going to see an explosion of streaming and
direct to consumer only to then find it almost re-aggregate itself under a new
bundle. And I think there's obviously a lot of evidence over the last two years
where that's exactly been what's been happening. So again, in, in many ways
like it doesn't change the fact that you're gonna still have people who
subscribe to cable or streaming or both.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (15m 30s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>But I think that direct to consumer is gonna be a very
important component. But I think increasingly direct to consumer and direct to
consumer as part of a bundling construct is going to likely be how many people
over time are subscribing to these different services. Which again, is is is
ironically back to where everything started with cable television.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (15m 52s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Are you seeing the, the growth in the bundling and are
you able to maintain the customer relationship as the bundles grow? I'm
thinking specifically of my customer relationship with your competitor Max,
which is somehow to this day still mediated by my at t account because I'm an
at t subscriber and I don't think they remembered that they spun the company
out. So I still have max through at t and it's actually quite confusing, right?
Because I can't adjust that account and whatever, I'm just gonna leave it alone.
Are you seeing that sort of thing play out as you bundle, as you go out to
market that someone else is owning the customer for you?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (16m 29s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>We might be a little bit unique. Yeah, because we
actually do not have that much bundling. The majority of our subscriber base
is, is direct to consumer and we have been very disciplined in how we've tried
to grow the subscriber base. You know, again, if you just go back a couple of
years, peacock launched in 2020 and at the time the market was really focused
on on demand scripted dramas, binge viewing and most ad free, you know, most
services were chasing that segment of the market and you know, we came to
market late if we're being honest about it.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (17m 9s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>But one of the benefits of coming to a market late is you
could assess the white space and like where you see opportunity. And so we
believe the opportunity for us was to position Peacock in the premium ad
supported space and not just kind of focus on premium scripted dramas and
movies and OnDemand even though that is a piece of the programming strategy.
But it was also about live sports and live news and unscripted programming and
multicultural programming. And again, playing to the strengths of, of what we
do as a company, as a broadcast company, which was to target a broad household
demographic. And the strategy there was that if we anchored ourselves in that
place, then we're not directly competing with other streamers, we're more
complimentary.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (17m 56s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>It was about completeness and in some ways being like the
best of cable TV for a relatively affordable price. And we also believed that
the future was not just gonna be on demand, even though on demand is a core
piece of the way we consume television, but that linear and live, which a lot
of people four years ago were were saying was dead. Like that was just
nonsense. And so that's why when we launched Peacock, we wanted to have, you
know, both linear networks. We, we launched with dozens of linear Channels, we
launched with a a library of 80,000 hours or, or we've grown the library to
over 80,000 hours of programming. And we were also very intentional about it
being ad supported.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (18m 38s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>'cause a dual revenue stream from our point of view was
better than a single revenue stream. And this is also core competency for what
we do at MVC with, with having a very strong ad sales team and deep
relationships with different advertisers. And we went to market with five
minutes of ads per hour, which again was a very controversial thing to do at
the time. But that's given us an advantage because you know, it's also allowed
us to focus on how do we innovate on the advertising beyond 15 to 32nd spots because
it'd been core to our DNA from the beginning. And the only reason I'm giving
you all this context is that when we built the service with, with that intent,
it really was different in the market. And so the vast majority of people who
signed up for Peacock signed up directly with the exception of Comcast.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (19m 23s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>We did do a bundling deal with Comcast and they currently
do wholesale peacock with certain certain of their, of their packages like
high-end gig broadband subscribers. But the overwhelming majority of our sub
base is direct to consumer. Now to answer your question though, like as the
market moves more and more towards bundling, I do see that becoming an
increasingly larger portion of our subscriber base. And again, taking the
history lesson from what we know about bundling, the one thing that arguably has
always held the bundle together has been sports and sports. You know, coming
from that side of the business, if you remember we launched Peacock, it was
supposed to be around the Tokyo Olympics.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (20m 6s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And so live sports was always fundamental to our strategy
and we've been aggregating live sports and sports rights fairly consistently
since we have launched Peacock with real purpose and intention knowing that not
only is sports gonna be a driver of acquisition, which has proven to be true
for us, but that sports is gonna be an important component that if the market
does move to bundling that not only will we solidify our place in that bundle,
but equally important if not more important is that you get the right wholesale
economics around how you're positioned in that bundle. And so we feel like
we're in a really good position based on the, the trajectory that we're on. But
if the market does move more towards bundling, we also feel like we're well
positioned to be included in in that kind of packaging.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (20m 51s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>But I don't think it's gonna take away from direct to
consumer. I just think for us it's gonna continue to augment the subscriber
base that we currently have.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Welcome back, I'm talking with NBC Universal's, Matt
STRs, who's described live sports as foundational to peacock since it launched
in 2020. Can I just unpack the phrase wholesale economics in a slightly more
Machiavellian way. What you're describing is you're gonna have the sports that
everybody wants, so when the bundles go out to market, you will charge a higher
rate or take a higher percentage of the rate people pay inside the bundle,
right? This is classically ESPN in the cable companies. ESPN got the highest
carriage rate of any of the cable companies, right? This is what you're
describing.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (24m 26s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Well I think, well I'm, I'm describing price value and,
and there's a high value on sports and that's obviously manifesting itself when
you just look at sports rights and the price that sports rights are going for
in the market. And so essentially yes, that, you know, I mean, yes to your
question that when that we see ourselves, I mean if you look at Peacock just as
an example, we have more live sports than any other streaming service. You know
when you look at the NFL, the Premier League Big 10, the Olympics, obviously
the NBA that's coming to peacock later next year. And you know, over the course
of a year we have like some live sports 300 of 365 days. And so we didn't get
there by accident. You know, we got there through real intention.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (25m 7s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Like we've had a very consistent strategy and vision from
the beginning. And I think what you're just seeing is us executing against that
strategy we would say internally like look, this is not a sprint, it's a
marathon maybe at a sprinter's pace, you know, because, you know, obviously the
market's moving very quickly. But we're fortunate to be part of a much broader
diversified company at Comcast with a senior management team that believes in
our vision, in our strategy. And that's allowed us to not do things like Chase
low value subs or do wholesale bundley deals without the right economic
relationships. And I think it's positioned us in a really, really good way
going forward because we don't feel like we have to do things artificially just
to kind of grow our sub base.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (25m 56s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Like we want to grow subs at the right ARPU revenue per
subscriber at the right level of engagement, you know, and and build a
subscriber base in the right way. And that's essentially what we've been doing
and we haven't wavered from that strategy or that vision from the beginning.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (26m 10s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>You described the different segments of the audience,
right? There are some people who still have traditional MDPD subscriptions and
they're just, they've got a satellite box or a cable box or whatever and
there's other people who are watching TikTok all day. I would segment 'em
differently. I think you've got older customers and younger customers and the
younger customers will almost certainly never sign up for a traditional
multi-channel cable bundle type thing, right? When you think about that split that
has a timeline on it, right? You're gonna lose older customers at some rate and
hopefully gain young younger customers at a faster rate. Are those lines gonna
sync up on time? Do you see the growth in the younger customer offsetting the
decline in the older customer?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (26m 52s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Because what, what's happened lately is right when you,
when you talk about the decline of pay tv, traditional pay tv, it's getting
faster is what everybody tells me. Yeah,<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (26m 60s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Well remember though the decline in pay TV isn't, I mean
this may sound crude, it's not just 'cause older people are passing away. I
mean some of it is people at all ages are making decisions where, you know,
they might feel like it's more valuable where they want to just cut the cord so
to speak and get streaming services and you could be at any age to to do that.
Yeah. But to answer your more broad question, yes, I mean that is essentially
the strategy where, which is why Peacock exists within NBCUniversal is as we
see the pay TV business still being a very good business, it's still is a very
profitable business for our company. And we've built really strong brands in
the pay TV ecosystem that streaming is a way for us to kind of drive more
growth and offset that decline and eventually become the broader growth engine
for the company.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (27m 51s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>But as I mentioned before, I think sometimes it's, it's
interpreted that legacy networks are somehow like dinosaurs and that that's,
you know, that that's, that's not really where people are spending a lot of
time. I see it very, very differently. I see it as a strength. You know when
you have a broadcast network and you could do something like the Olympics and
you're averaging over 30 million viewers a day, that actually becomes a huge
promotional vehicle for you to also drive awareness and audience for your
streaming service. When you have networks like Bravo with really deep fandoms
and you can tap into that fandom on a streaming service by making some of that
content available to cord cutters, it creates a little bit of an infinity loop
where linear networks and pay TV can drive audience to streaming and awareness
for streaming and vice versa.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (28m 44s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Streaming can drive people back to linear. You know,
another example of this would be a show like Yellowstone. You know, not
everybody maybe is aware but Yellowstone we have the exclusive rights to stream
Yellowstone on Peacock when we licensed Yellowstone, it was not the number one
show in television, which is part of the reason why we got the rights to it
because we took a bet that we thought it was a really good show. But that show
was on Paramount network, which is a cable network on various tiers of cable.
It's not even a basic cable network. What happened there I think fairly
predictably, 'cause it is an excellent show, is that people were finding it on
streaming 'cause we were the exclusive home for it.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (29m 27s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>They were then catching up as the show progressed in its
seasons and then they were tuning back in to watch the new season in some cases
on Paramount network and then that that was driving people back to Peacock
where maybe they wanted to watch it from the beginning or they wanted to catch
up and it became this really interesting Infinity loop. And this is the same
thing that happened with Breaking Bad when it was available on a MC and another
streaming service or or Mad Men. And so I, I look at it very differently. I
look at it as this is a strength and if we can figure out ways to continue
programming these different platforms that they can continue to drive the
audiences in a way that becomes a, a differentiator and a growth engine for us.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (30m 8s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And again, it goes back to why we've organized ourselves
in the way that we have, which is to really think of it as a portfolio.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (30m 14s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Yeah, two things. One, I appreciate that you won't name
your competitors. Very good. You're talking about Netflix two, I could talk to
you for the rest of the, our time about Yellowstone and whether the Dutton
family is rich or not, which is deeply confusing as that show goes on. I just
wanna be clear, they have a helicopter but then they like need to sell the,
it's a very confusing,<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (30m 35s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>They can't pay for the gas.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (30m 37s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>It's so confusing. It's a great show once on just a Call
of Duty character. I really could just talk about Yellowstone for the rest of
the rest of the time. You've talked a lot about being the place where the
customer goes every day, opening the app every day, having the relationship. A
lot of what you're talking about is being the interface for television, but
Peacock has to run on devices from Apple and Roku and Google and whoever else
on Samsung TVs, all of those companies, they want a piece of your ad sales,
they want a piece of your subscription revenue. What are those relationships
like? Are they in your way? Are they something that you're just handling? Are
they not on your mind? Well,<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (31m 13s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>No, I, I think when you're looking at delivering a
streaming service, we obviously need to be available on every single platform
and device, but the majority of video consumption is still on the television.
And so these distributor relationships are really important. I think we have
really good relationships with all the different partners. You even saw that in
the Olympics. Like Roku for example, built a fantastic interface to promote the
Olympics. Apple and Amazon did a really great job promoting, I'm not trying to
name drop any specific platform, but I think we've got a, the right business
relationship where they're incentivized to sell Peacock and participate in our
growth. And we, we benefit also from the, the placement. What I meant when I
said frequency and habituation is I think of it as like how often nely do you
use your phone and the, I could tell you the average consumer uses their phone
or looks at their phone two to 300 times a day and you probably never turn off
your phone.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (32m 11s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>It's, I know for me it's the, the first thing I look at
in the morning. It's the last thing I look at at night. I even use it as my
alarm clock. I never turn off my phone. Now think about your tv, well you
probably turn on your TV when you wanna watch it and you maybe do that a couple
of times a day. And then what do you do? You turn it off. And so I'm looking at
it differently and say, what do you need to do where someone never wants to
turn off their TV and they want to open up our app every single day. That to me
is the ambition I'm challenging my team to think through. And so that
influences decisions we're making around, that's a very different dynamic
around how you program and manage a service if that's your ambition. But that's
where I think we need to go as a streaming platform.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (32m 53s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And you know, the closest example might be a show like
Love Island, which was a huge hit for us over the summer. That show was on five
days a week. And so that obviously required you if you were watching that show
to tune in five days a week. And that is part of the habituation and frequency
that I was referring to that I don't think is really discussed a lot when
people are evaluating streaming services.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (33m 16s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Let me ask you some of the decoder questions out, 'cause
I think we've led up to them pretty directly. NB Cuni Universal is a, a big
company. You've got a broadcast division, you've got a sports division, these
are old famous groups inside the company. How is your group organized within NB
Cuni Universal?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (33m 34s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Right now? We, we are all part of, as I mentioned, the
same, the same group inside a, which reports into Mark Lazarus. And Mark
Lazarus oversees all TV and streaming, as I mentioned, like initially it was
like Peacock was like its own separate entity end-to-end, like own programming,
own marketing, own support services like HR and legal, et cetera. Everything
was kind of insulated. And we have been methodically breaking down those silos.
And so we really believe the opportunities to come, you know, around like more
shared services. And so as I mentioned, like we now have one programming
division across the entire portfolio, which reports into Donna Langley who also
oversees our movie studio.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (34m 20s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And so now when we're making programming decisions for
broadcast cable or streaming, you've got one group that's overseeing that
strategy and that vision, which again, I think helps us as we make decisions
around content that could potentially play across multiple platforms in
different windows. You know, we work very, very closely with the, the marketing
department of NBC. And as you probably notice like NBC promotes Peacock and
locks up peacock whenever they're promoting their primetime show. And so we work
very closely, the Peacock marketing team works very closely with the NBC
marketing team and we have something which we call Symphony, where we all
contribute a certain amount of inventory that we use to cross promote across
all of our platforms.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (35m 4s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And so if you're gonna see a show like Fight Night, which
is a, a new show on Peacock from Will Packer, you know, you're gonna see that
promoted on NBC on our cable networks on Peacock because of how we're
partnering on Symphony. And we've done something very similar with like we've
consolidated decision sciences and research, which is really the center of
gravity around all the analytics and the reporting. And so again, you have one
team that's looking at that holistically across linear and across streaming.
And we've also, as back to what I said earlier about D two C, we have one
product team and one technology team that's managing a single platform.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (35m 44s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And this is kind of a really, we haven't really talked
about this publicly, but maybe it's just worth just spending one minute on.
What we're trying to effectuate here is, you know, NBC we've built as part of
Peacock, a fairly large team of people that are building out our streaming
platform, both on the product side and on the tech and on the engineering side,
our sister company Sky, which operates in the uk, Italy and Germany
predominantly, they have a streaming service that you may be familiar with called
Now tv. And these were two different groups with fairly large teams that were
building different platforms in some cases similar features. And we recognized
that there was an opportunity to consolidate it all under one team, which we
did.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (36m 30s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And it's called the Global Streaming Platform group,
which sits inside of D two C. I know I'm throwing a lot of acronyms at you.
This<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (36m 36s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Is what the coder's all about. I'm ready for it.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (36m 38s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Okay. And so, so GSP is made up now of thousands of
people that report into my team that are all across the the world. They're in
the uk, they're in Lisbon, they're in Prague, they're in New York, they're
like, we've got a, we built one holistic team and that platform is what powers
peacock. But this, but this same platform is what powers a joint venture that
we have in Eastern and central Europe with Power Paramount called Sky Showtime.
It's the GSP platform that we've built as one company. It also powers the
platform that we launched in over 50 countries in Africa through a venture that
we have with a distributor called Multi-Choice, that's also the GSP platform.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (37m 23s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And next year we are gonna actually migrate now TV onto
this one GSP platform. And so this has unlocked tremendous efficiencies across
the company for us. It also, I think has been like a huge motivator for the
people that work on this because now they're working on one platform and it can
increase the velocity where, you know, they could build things once and not
have to, you know, necessarily have teams competing against each other. And in
many ways this is what positioned us so well in my opinion, for things like the
exclusive NFL playoff game in January and the exclusive NFL game that we had a
few weeks ago in Brazil with the Eagles and the Packers, it's also what
positioned us so well as a platform, in my opinion, for the Paris Olympics.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (38m 9s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And it's because we've had this maniacal focus on how do
we get more scale, more efficiency with a real, you know, commitment to like
it. We want streaming to work like tv. And what I mean by that is you don't
think about it when you turn on the tv. Generally it's a little bit like
electricity. You don't think about electricity unless there's a blackout, then
you think about electricity. But the electricity is what powers everything in
your house. Everything that you're using in your house is likely getting
powered by electricity. And that was in a way the ambition that we had with the
platform, which is can we make the platform so stable, so scalable that latency
buffering, you know, crashes if too many people are using it out of sync audio
with video, all the things that have plagued streaming for years.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (39m 0s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Let's do everything we can to just get that right. And if
we could do that in the big way, then that gives us permission then to drive
innovation. And so we have been the last two years really organizing ourselves
in that way, building a platform because live streaming, especially if you
haven't noticed, it's very hard. But we've been really committed to that vision
and I think I'm proud of the team of what we've accomplished because it allowed
us to then do something like the Paris Olympics, which we feel really good
about because all of the things that we introduced we've wanted to introduce
for years, but we didn't believe we had permission to do that until we got what
I just call the basics, right?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (39m 44s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Yeah. And to me the basics are you've, nothing matters
from an innovative standpoint if the platform doesn't work. And so I feel like
we've been very disciplined and focused on doing that and we've structured
ourselves around that ambition over the last couple of years.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (39m 57s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Does that product team report to you? Is that part of
your group?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (40m 0s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>It is, yeah. Product Big teams report<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (40m 2s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Doing. How big is that team? I don't<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (40m 4s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Think we've ever disclosed it publicly, but it's in the
thousands. We've got thousands of people. It has grown considerably over the
last few years. And again, I think as we built this platform and demonstrated
the capabilities, it's actually allowed me to, to partner with other parts of
our company to shift more and more resources towards the global streaming
platform team. And so this has really been the tip of the spear in how we're
continuing to build out all of our technology on streaming going forward. And
we work very closely, of course with Comcast Cable, who has a very large team
as well, but they have been more focused on connected TVs and connected TV
devices.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (40m 44s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And so there's like, there's like a complimentary nature
to how we work together, but our focus has been, as you can imagine, mostly on
streaming video.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (40m 52s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Yeah. One of the things that's really interesting about
what you're describing is you have a core platform and then the platform is
expressed through various products, right? Peacock, the Now service, whatever
you're doing in Africa. Do you ever find yourself just looking at the Trello
board, like litigating people's priorities? Like the Peacock team wants this
feature, but the now team wants another feature and the platform has to make a
decision about what goes first because that like every tech company looks like
that? Well,<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (41m 19s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The answer is of course, yes. I mean it, which is, which
is a very classic kind of challenge that you have when you become a shared
service as a platform. And there's ways around that though. I mean, we do carve
out a certain amount of capacity to the different services that we're
supporting. Like so for example, in some cases there's commonality like Sky
Showtime has advertising, well, they actually benefited because we had already
launched advertising on Peacock. And so when they wanna launch advertising in
Poland, that's a relatively easy thing for us just to turn on because it's
already been built. But you know, they, like in Africa, just as an example, you
know, the viewing behavior is much more oriented towards mobile viewing because
they don't have the brand, the broadband proliferation that we have in, in
countries like the United States.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (42m 6s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And so the majority of streaming happens on mobile
devices just because of the bandwidth constraints. And there's also different
payment structures because most people don't always have the ability to like
pay by the month. And so they need to maybe pay by the day or they in some
cases go and they have to go to retail environments where they buy vouchers to
pay. And so we have to build capabilities that are more unique to that market.
And so you have to be able to arbitrage certain capacity depending on the
priorities, but there's a benefit, which is when you build these capabilities,
we're building it once. And so now we have that capability. And so if we ever
wanted to introduce that functionality in other markets, it's not like we're
building it once in it's throwaway work, we can actually leverage it and it
benefits other parts of the platform.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (42m 52s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And so, you know, it is, it is a kind of a balancing act,
but I feel like generally Peacock is the, certainly the center of where we're
focusing the vast majority of our resources, given the priority, the importance
of it. And I would say the majority of how we're using the platform in other
countries is drafting behind Peacock in the Peacock roadmap with the exceptions
of some of the things that I just mentioned that are more unique to those
markets.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (43m 18s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>A lot of companies that build big expensive core
infrastructure like you're describing, once they've built it, they wanna sell
it, right? They want to go monetize it, white label it, give it to other
people, ex get some more value outta the investment. Do you have enough scale
with your own products and your own partnerships to support the ongoing
investment here? Or would you go white label it to one of your partners?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (43m 39s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>No, we have no ambition of white labeling it. We're being
very surgical, I would say, and methodical on how we're thinking of this. And
so in the examples that I've given, you know, we have partnerships, you know,
it's, you know, the, the Sky Showtime venture is a 50 50 venture. The venture
in Africa that I mentioned, you know, we have an equity stake in that venture,
obviously we own Sky is a com as a broader Comcast company. And so, so we're,
I, I think that our, our ambition is not to build a white label platform. The
benefit of what I'm describing is that as we've kind of created these
partnerships, which has allowed me to get more scale, it also subsidizes the
development for Peacock.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (44m 20s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And so by me strategically licensing our platform in the
ways that I've described, like it's bringing in actually another revenue stream
to me that I'm then able to use to add more resources to accelerate the
development. And again, all these pieces is what's positioned us in a way to
allow us to do some of the big things that we've been able to do over the last
couple of years around, especially around live programming.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (44m 44s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>You've described the core platform as a shared service a
few times. You've described how Peacock went from being inside of an incubator
at NBCUniversal to now being part of the broader portfolio. Do you think of
what you're doing as the sort of tip of the spear to get new customers, younger
customers? Do you think eventually you'll become the center of gravity instead
of a shared service? Or is it always just gonna be part of the portfolio?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (45m 8s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I, me, I mentioned earlier that, you know, when I came to
NBC from, from Comcast, you know, Steve Burke called me and, and I've known
Steve for a long time, he actually hired me at Comcast when he was the
president of Comcast. And it was kind of full circle when he asked me to then
come to NBC when he became the CEO, when he was the CEO of NBC. But he said
something to me on the phone, which resonated, which is he said, you know,
peacock's our future. And I interpreted that not just that it's the future revenue
growth or growth for subscribers, I interpreted as it's like, this is like how
we could build a new culture. That's what excited me. And so, you know, part of
what I'm really proud about that we've done inside of NBC since I've been there
is, is not only established Peacock is the fastest growing streamer and you
know, our last earnings, I think, you know, we've had 33 million subscribers
and, you know, continuing to show bottom line growth.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (46m 2s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I'm also proud of the culture that we've built inside of
NBC, which to me is equally important, you know, and, and, and I've probably
spent a, a vast majority of my time really on how we build that culture in a
way that I believe is gonna position us for success. And you know, it's around
collaboration, it's around communication transparency. Remember Peacock was
born in Covid. We, we literally were, I was literally in my house building a
new service that I had to coordinate with hundreds of other people that were
not in the same room with me. And that forced a lot of communication, a lot of
transparency, a lot of trust, a lot of people feeling ownership, and I've been
doing everything I can with the help of others to foster that, that sense of
culture.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (46m 51s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And that started to spread into other parts of the
company. And so I think from that respect, yes, I do think that Peacock is in
many ways trying to change the company from, in some ways, from the inside out
by also being respectful of the expertise of other parts of the company inside
NBC. But I do think over time, you know, our future is very much anchored on
streaming and peacock and that is, but, but the difference is everyone inside
the company owns a piece of that. It's not one group anymore, it's now news,
sports, entertainment. Every single part of our company has their DNA in some
way connected back to Peacock.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

way Peacock really fits into the global Comcast organization. This leads right
into the other decoder question. You're obviously a change agent inside of NBC,
right? You're, you're going around all these groups, getting them to
participate. When you were on the cable side, I'm assuming you had a, a
different attitude towards making change. How do you make decisions now? What's
your framework and how has it changed? Well,<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (50m 43s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Just to take a sip, I, I actually didn't have a different
perspective when I was at cable, only because over 10 years ago, you know, I
was part of a group that was nested inside of Comcast cable, which was called
Comcast Interactive Media. And we were there to disrupt the cable business.
Yeah. And that's exactly what we did. And so being a change agent is actually
something I enjoy. And, but I, but, but being a change agent in the right way,
I think is also important, which is through collaboration, you know, through
challenging people, but doing it, I think in a respectful way and, and, and in
more of like an intellectual way and getting people to buy in. I really enjoy
that aspect of the roles that I've played at Comcast and the roles that I've
played at NBC.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (51m 29s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>But, you know, it's very, I'm not sure if this is
answering your question directly, but I think it's, you know, our, our goal
within NBC is we want to get peacock to scale. You know, we have subscriber
targets that we want to get to. We certainly want to get to profitability and
we've gotta, are you<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (51m 46s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>We are not profitable now, but it's investing. The way I
look at it, and this is kind of something that's so interesting because, and I
just ignore it to be honest with you, but you know, it's like you'll see press
articles where it's like, peacock is losing money. I mean, we are a startup
business. I've never seen a star. I mean, you know, did Amazon make money
immediately? I think that you've gotta have a much longer term view here where
I say, no, we are investing in a business. And so what you're looking for when
you're investing in a new business is are you growing, are you hitting your
KPIs and the metrics? Are you achieving the long range plan objectives? And the
answer to those are, yes, we are, we're, we're actually exceeding those
objectives, which only gives us confidence that we're on the right path.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (52m 33s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And so we have a long range plan and we're executing
against it. And so getting peacock to scale, getting peacock to profitability,
but again, doing it in a way inside the broader portfolio is really where our,
where we're focusing a lot of our resources and our, our efforts and we feel
really good that we're on the right path.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (52m 51s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>How do you make decisions inside of that framework?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (52m 54s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>You know, in order to achieve what I just said, if you're
a subscription business, you need to say, okay, what's gonna drive acquisition,
which is an important ingredient to a subscription service. What's gonna drive
retention and AC and an engagement? What is gonna drive frequency? You know,
which is something that's not really talked a lot about with streaming
services, but it's something that I'm very focused on, which is, you know, how
do you actually change the paradigm where you want people to go into your app
every single day? And I, again, that's not the way people typically think of
streaming, because if it's all on demand or it's all binge viewing, you're
essentially telling the consumer it's there whenever you want it.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (53m 35s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>There's no urgency to it. And we want to actually get
people to open up our app every single day, because that just gives you more at
bats, so to speak, to try to drive them into other parts of the service, which
then drives more engagement, more monetization, better retention. And so when
you look at it through that lens, it drives a lot of our decision making. So
our programming decisions around is this, you know, what's the, it's like a
mutual fund. You need a balance. It can't be one extreme or the other. If
you're too focused on acquisition, then it's a leaky bucket. You'll get a lot
of people to sign up for your service, but then you'll just lose them because
you don't have enough content to engage and retain them. And then vice versa,
if you've got a, a lot of content that drives engagement, that's not gonna get
you to scale because you need the, and so we are managing it almost like I
think of it as like a mutual fund.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (54m 22s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And so we have a budget, we have a programming budget, we
have a marketing budget. You know, we have a p and l inside of NBCUniversal
that's dedicated to Peacock, even though we are part of the broader portfolio.
And so we're making decisions around what do we need to do in order to achieve
those goals. But I feel like we got rocket fuel because I have the added
benefit of tapping into this broader portfolio that could materially add more
marketing value. Or remember, we're the home for all the universal movies. And
so when, when Twisters or Wicked, you know, goes into theaters, you know, we're
the next stop, you know, after the transactional premium transactional window.
We're the exclusive home for all the next day NBC programming.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Wait, can, can I ask you, ask you about that real quick?
'cause I, I've been very curious about this. That strategy has been tried by
some of your larger competitors. Disney notably tried this. Max has tried this
in, in different ways. And one of the issues there is your studio doesn't get
to go to market and say, how much do you want to pay for twisters in, in the,
in the first window after the pay window and get bids from Netflix and Max and,
and, and Peacock. Do you have to bid, do you win? Is how is that, how are those
economics accounted for?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (55m 36s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Well, you've probably heard this, like, and this is
something that's funny because a lot of people don't believe this, but some of
the most contentious negotiations happen internally. Yeah, of course. You know,
and, and it's family,<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (55m 49s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (55m 50s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Yeah, yeah. Ands sometimes it's counterintuitive to
people. But the short answer is yes. I mean, look, we have profit participants.
We have to keep negotiations at arms length. And in many cases our content is,
and the price of our content is being set by the market. You know, we don't
exclusively license every single piece of content on Peacock. You know, I
mentioned our movies, you know, our movies, we are the first window, but then,
you know, there's a pay one A and then there's a pay one B. And so there are
other third parties that, you know, our, our teams license their content to and
So, it establishes market dynamics that we then need to negotiate against. So
we are paying our fair share when it comes to programming. And even in the case
of the NBC next day programming, you know, that content was available before on
another streaming service.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (56m 35s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And so there was a set value that was already ascribed to
it that we essentially had to step into if we then wanted to migrate that
content onto Peacock, which we did. And so my only point was, as a company, we
made the decision that we wanted Peacock to be the home for our content, which
meant that we were gonna also have to put our money where our mouth is, so to
speak, and make the investment to allow us to claw back that programming. And
we've been doing that. But by doing that, it also continues to tether us
directly into other parts of the company in a very positive way. Because again,
we're, we're all working together to continue to achieve these collective goals
around Peacock.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>You are not our first executives who will not name the
competitors. We, we just had Greg on the show and you know, Netflix is a public
company. We can look at their economics, they're profitable, they're doing
well. We can see also inside of the business, they're investing in essentially
cheaper programming, right? Lots of live comedy specials, lots of reality
shows. They're not doing the big premium dramas the way that they used to be
doing. You've got the big catalog from NBC. Do you, does that give you the
ability to say, okay, we're gonna make the money again, like Friends is long
paid for. That is pure margin for Peacock. We're gonna invest in paying more
for Universal's catalog, because that'll keep people here.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (58m 14s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Well, listen, I kind of what I said earlier, like we
we're playing to our strengths. Yeah. And one of our strengths, and, and to be
honest, I did not appreciate this when I first came to NBC, just how much
people love the NBC content. Like, and I'm not just talking about the current
programming, I'm talking about, you know, the, the deep catalog of content that
NBC has and you know, there's a very, very large, you know, we have 80,000
hours of programming on Peacock on Demand. That has been a huge advantage, you
know, to have a show like the Office Parks and Rec Brooklyn Nine Nine, you
know, to be able to have the Dick Wolf catalog of Law and Orders in Chicago's
to have every season of SNL.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (58m 57s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I mean, these are things that again, play to our
strengths that we knew drives a lot of engagement. And, and so that's been a
benefit. But just back to your other comment, when I said about consistency of
vision, we never subscribe to the fact that streaming has to be just scripted
dramas. Like that is a big piece of it for sure. Scripted dramas do drive
acquisition and help with brand development. And you can almost probably think
of a show that you could ascribe to a streaming service as an, you know, kind
of like it put it on the map, so to speak. Yeah. As an inflection point. So, so
that was always part of the calculus for us as well. But we always knew and
believed that streaming could be so much more.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (59m 41s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And so unscripted live sports, live news that's been part
of Peacock from day one. And so arguably like it's the hunter becoming the
hunted where you're seeing other streaming services, I would argue we're moving
more into our space, that we're moving into their space. Yeah. Including the
fact that we've been very committed from the beginning to an ad model, which,
you know, we believed was the big opportunity for us. 'cause we knew that
eyeballs were gonna continue to shift more to streaming for all the reasons
that you said earlier. And we also knew that the majority of streaming happens
on the tv, even though most people thought it happened on the phone. But the TV
is like the new TV and you, you're now seeing every streaming service for the
most part, launching an ad tier.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (1h 0m 23s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And so the, the market is evolving, but it's evolving I
think, in a very predictable way. But it, but we really have been very
consistent with our vision and strategy. And I think that's actually given us
an advantage because it's allowed us several years to invest in live
programming and invest in advertising as part of our platform DNA, which just
puts us in a very different place in our trajectory, compared possibly some
other services.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (1h 0m 49s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Yeah. Let's talk about sports and the Olympics and the
NFLA little bit. Just to wrap up, the Olympics were a big hit on peacock. The
app was ready, the features were incredible. I'm curious, there was a lot of
stuff going on in Peacock. You had the Gold Zone, you had live highlights.
There was an AI Al Michaels situation, there were replays, there's multiple
Channels. How did you integrate the product and programming teams there? Was
that a single team? Did the Olympics team from NBC come and say, we're gonna do
the Gold Zone, get it ready? How did that work?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (1h 1m 22s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Well, remember it's from a product and technology
perspective, it's this GSP team, this platform that I mentioned. So it's the
same team. And since we're all part of the same group, we literally sit right
next to the NBC sports team and next to the NBC entertainment team. And so we
work hand in glove with this, these different teams. And when we brainstorm
ideas and we identify where we want to go and where we see the opportunity. And
I think that, you know, we kind of recognized with Paris early on, like the
stakes were high, we're coming out of Covid for the last two Olympics, where
there was questions about, about the cultural relevancy of the Olympics going
forward.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (1h 2m 3s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I think if I'm being very candid, I don't believe Peacock
really fulfilled the promise of the Olympics for streamers and for cord cutters
with Beijing and with Tokyo for a variety of reasons. But I think that there
was real questions about whether or not we could really deliver the experience
that we knew we needed to deliver. And so the stakes were high and we take it
so seriously. I like, it's a privilege to work on the Olympics. That's really
how a lot of us feel. And, and it's a tremendous responsibility. And so we
really set out to, to do something that we, this was the moment where I
mentioned like we thought we were ready to surprise a delight and introduce
features that we believe potentially could change the way people in experience
sports.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (1h 2m 49s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>What I don't think people appreciate I, and this again is
just the benefit of being a part of a bigger company, is that this Paris has
been 10 years in the making. You know, like, so for example, when you went on
to Peacock and you watched a replay, like maybe you missed an event and you
wanted to watch Simone Biles making the content available on demand and for
replays, that was first done in London 2012 at Comcast. That was the first time
we made all the Olympics available on demand. When you saw the Gold Zone with
Scott Hanson, which was fantastic. And the NBC sports team did an amazing job
producing that. We actually tested that. If you look in Sochi in 2014, we
tested the Gold Zone.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (1h 3m 30s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And, and that idea when people were watching Snoop, who
became the ambassador of the Olympics, which is like a surreal thing because he
became so relatable to so many people. We tested Snoop in Tokyo in 2020 where
we gave him a show on Olympic show on Peacock. 'cause it was too controversial
to put him on NBC at the time. And so this has been an evolution that has
gotten us to this place. But it is an example where every part of the company
was firing on all cylinders. It also speaks to what I said earlier where, you
know, peacock was the number one app. We had more digital consumption on
Peacock for Paris than every other Olympics combined. And at the same time
though, there was always a question of, well, is that gonna cannibalize the
primetime show for NBC?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (1h 4m 16s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And that didn't happen. The NBC primetime show had a
record number of viewing because people were watching on Peacock during the
day. But then they wanted to see the storytelling that NBC does so well during
primetime. And that's that infinity loop that I was referring to. And So, it
really is an example of like, I think what plays to our strengths, what we do
well as a company, we were preparing for years for that moment. We're really
proud of what we were able to deliver. And I, I think in many respects, there's
no going back. Yeah. Because when you could deliver that kind of experience and
you get that response, we're now looking at it and saying, well, how do we then
apply that to the NBA? How do we apply that to the Premier League? How do we
apply that to other types of experiences?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (1h 4m 57s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And this is the next frontier for streaming from my point
of view. Because right now streaming is arguably a two dimensional service,
which is I sign up for your service based on your content and your price. I
think the next iteration will be product. How do you start to use the product
in a way that differentiates the experience from one streaming service to
another, where arguably now there's more similarity than differences. The
Olympics is an example of what I mean when I say the product can become part of
the value proposition of where we want to go over time. If I were to project
out in the future, I actually think the next version of where I then want to go
with Peacock and with streaming is to expand the aperture even beyond video.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (1h 5m 43s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And it goes back to what I said about time. How do you
get more share of time? And if, if five hours is the ceiling for video, how do
we start tapping into other ways that we can drive engagement on our platform
and add more value? Because you know that it's not a streaming platform, it's
an entertainment platform. That's the way we're starting to think of it. And
we've got lots of other parts of the company that could be leaning into how do
we get more share of time, but also how do we start to get more share of
wallet. And like you can imagine one day, Neely, that you subscribe to Peacock
and not only do you get this great video service, but maybe if you're a Peacock
subscriber, you get a free movie ticket to Fandango. Maybe if you're a Peacock
subscriber, you get early mission to universal theme parks.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (1h 6m 27s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Maybe, you know, given our advertiser relationships,
maybe you get discounts to McDonald's. I mean, so we are thinking very
differently, I believe in how we wanna evolve the value proposition beyond just
what it is today anticipating kind of where we think we need to go as a
platform.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (1h 6m 46s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>You had a big influx of subscribers for the Olympics. How
many of you retained, we've talked about this a lot. Have you held onto a lot
of those subscribers?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (1h 6m 53s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>We haven't disclosed the number, but I guess one way to
think of it is, 90% of people who engage with sports on Peacock watch other
content. Yeah. And so again, you know, we, we look at sports, there's no
better, there's no bigger fandom than sports. And so sports, as I mentioned
earlier, is a very effective tactic to drive acquisition. We've shown that with
the NFL exclusive games and NFL just regular season games. We've shown that,
certainly we've seen that with the Olympics, but we also have such a great
portfolio of other programming. And so the, and the way that that's manifesting
itself, just to kind of build on this for a second, is that when you look at
something like the, the playoff game that we did earlier in the year, we had
the no, that was the most viewership engagement we've ever had on Peacock.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (1h 7m 47s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>But the next day after the playoff game was the biggest
on demand usage day we ever had on Peacock. And one of our originals, Ted, the
Seth McFarland show, was the number one original we ever had on Peacock. And
then the traders, which just actually won the Emmy for best unscripted
competition show was the number one unscripted show on Peacock. And so we have
the ability to bend the curve when we could take somebody who comes in for
sports, but you know, utilize the product in a way to interact, engage them
with other content on our platform. And again, that's the benefit of having
such a large catalog of programming for each individual in the home.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (1h 8m 26s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Sports rights are getting more and more expensive over
time, producing the Olympics, obviously not cheap. NBC can do all this because
it can monetize that in several different ways, right? You have broadcast,
which is lucrative, you've got cable, which is still lucrative. And now if
Peacock, will Peacock ever get to a place where it can support one of these
large sports rights deals all by itself?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (1h 8m 45s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Well, if you look at like something like our WWE deal,
which is sports entertainment, all of those events used to be pay-per-view
events. And those are now exclusively available on Peacock. And that was a deal
that we entered into that even though we have a relationship with the WWE for
USA, that was a decision that we made that was very specific to just Peacock.
But I would, I actually think of it a little bit differently. We're not really
focused on like sports that are unique to just Peacock. I think one of the
benefits of being part of this bigger portfolio is we have the ability to make
content like sports available on different platforms. And when you look at
something like the NBA, which we're very excited about, and obviously is a, a
very big deal for us as a company, these rights only come up every decade.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (1h 9m 33s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And so it's nice to have these rights back where they
belong on NBC and on Peacock. I think part of the reason that we were able to
enter into that relationship is because we're more than just streaming and that
we have, you know, such a broad reach with broadcast and with cable. And so
that's, I see that as a strength. And, and to me that's something that I would
want to continue leaning into as we evaluate sports, right? Deal rights deals
going forward. And my belief is most leagues see it the same way. That they
don't necessarily want it to be limited to DISC streaming because you still
have such a large audience that's available on these other platforms, including
pay television.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (1h 10m 8s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>All right. You've walked into my trap by talking about
the product and talking about sports. What do I have to do to get a true 4K NFL
game on Peacock? How much I'll pay you directly?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (1h 10m 42s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>N we C you know, I, I talked to, I know Neil at YouTube
like, what's keeping you, and he is like millions of partnerships in
broadcaster. NBC owns the whole chain. You've got the broadcast booth, you've
got the production, you've got the rights directly, you've got the platform.
What's stopping you.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (1h 10m 57s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>We wanna make sure that when we're delivering content,
especially content that's simulcast across the different properties that our
ambition is, we wanna deliver it in the highest quality universally. And so if
we're gonna deliver the content in 4K on Peacock, I think it's also important
that we're able to deliver it in 4K to our broadcast stations and to our cable
and satellite distributors. And So. it adds a little bit of complexity in
having that focus. And so the relationships and how we approach the market is
meaningful to us. And we want make sure that we're doing it in a very
comprehensive way for all of our partners. Not just not just one<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3 (1h 11m 53s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Do you see demand for, for higher video quality? This is
the thing that I worry about is that people pick convenience over quality all
the time. And the demand for for 4K or high bit rate, it just isn't there.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4 (1h 12m 4s):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Well, listen, I, I think I'm gonna put back on my Comcast

if they have a 4K television or they think they're watching in 4K and they're,
you know, they're watching in like seven 20 p. And so I don't think the average
consumer generally really does understand it. 'cause it's, it is confusing
like, what is 4K, what's ultra hd? What's HDR? There's a lot of marketing
rhetoric. And so I don't know if it's being really driven by the consumer as
much as maybe a subsegment of the consumer that really is more acute to like

<p class=MsoNormal><b>To notice the differences. This guy. But I, but I will
tell you, our ambition is to offer the best and highest quality video and

technically that is what we're building towards. Whether the consumer is
necessarily asking for it or not, we wanna offer them the best and highest

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Title - It’s official, people aren’t watching TV as much
as they used to<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/15/23833516/nielsen-tv-cable-50-percent-decline-viewership-bum-bums<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>It finally happened, at least according to a new metric
Nielsen began using two years ago: linear TV now accounts for less than 50
percent of all TV usage. This probably isn’t a surprise unless you're reading
this on the couch while watching the NBC Nightly News. Between YouTube, TikTok,
and streaming channels, people have a lot of ways to occupy their video-viewing
time.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Approximately two years ago, Nielsen started using a new
metric for measuring how people spend their TV-watching time. It built in
buckets for broadcast TV, cable TV, streaming, and a catchall called “Other”
that accounted for people using gaming consoles and media players. The latest
report shows broadcast and cable TV each dropping about one percent from June
2023 to July 2023. Streaming and the “Other” category each gained that one
percent in the same time period.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>But if you compare things to a year ago, the decline is
much more pronounced. The analytics firm showed that cable usage had dropped by
12.5 percent since this time last year, accounting for less than a third of
viewers’ time, while broadcast TV slid to just one-fifth of total watch time in
American homes.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The future of TV is up in the air<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The future of streaming is ads<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>At the same time, Nielsen says streaming had a
record-breaking month led by YouTube and Netflix, which together accounted for
almost as much viewer time spent as broadcast alone. Nielsen’s “Other” category
has been up consistently for the last three months, although it was actually
down a percentage point from the same time last year.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>This trend is supported by the latest numbers from
Leichtman Research, which dropped a report estimating cable providers lost an
estimated 1.73 million subscribers in the second quarter of 2023. “We think the
metrics for linear TV are all bad,” Macquarie media analyst Tim Nolle noted in
an August 14 investor report The Hollywood Reporter acquired.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And they are! Some execs like Netflix’s Reed Hastings
have even been loudly and proudly banging a drum heralding the death of linear
TV for years now. Just last year, he even declared 2032 as the year linear TV
would officially die. Meanwhile, Bob Iger over at Disney just recently
announced his desire to find minority stakeholders for ESPN and said its linear
cable channels “may not be core to Disney,” citing declining cable subscription
numbers.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>There’s still a chance for traditional TV. Free
ad-supported TV services like Tubi and The Roku Channel are increasing in
popularity, and if you talk to anyone in the broadcast TV business, they’ll
tell you ATSC 3.0 could save TV too. But traditional TV isn’t just competing
with Disney Plus and Max; it's competing with YouTube and TikTok, and other
video providers that can rely on creators to churn out content faster and more
cheaply than NBC or CBS. So Nielsen’s news of declining viewership isn’t a surprise
as much as it was always a somewhat depressing inevitability.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Antenna television is back. In recent years, millions of
cord-cutters have rediscovered antennas as a reliable way to watch broadcast
networks like ABC, NBC, and FOX, all for free — and now, broadcasters are eager
to get the rest of us hooked. They’ve been marching ahead with the deployment
of ATSC 3.0, a next-generation broadcast format that supports 4K, HDR, Dolby
Atmos audio, and even interactive apps over the air, no cable or streaming
subscription required.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>A little over a year ago, one of the country’s biggest
broadcasters made an unexpected acquisition to help bolster the transition: The
E.W. Scripps Company, which operates dozens of ABC, NBC and Fox stations as
well as a handful of nationwide broadcast networks, quietly bought Nuvyyo, a
Canadian startup best known for its Tablo DVR devices for cord-cutters. The
acquisition, which hasn’t been previously reported, is part of Scripps’
multibillion-dollar bet on acquiring stations, networks, and spectrum for an
ATSC 3.0-powered antenna TV future.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>But the transition to ATSC 3.0 has been anything but
smooth. Five years after its launch, the format is still not available in many
major markets. Support from TV makers has been limited, and some of the
promised features likely won’t be available for years to come. Meanwhile, free
streaming TV channels are growing by leaps and bounds and are quickly becoming
a viable alternative to both cable and antenna TV. As it stands, the future of
broadcast TV is looking remarkably fuzzy.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>A big promise, a small start<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>ATSC 3.0 is to broadcast television what 5G was to mobile
a few years ago: a mixture of buzzwords and real innovation, something that’s
definitely coming, but no one really quite knows yet what its true impact will
be. And on paper, there’s a lot to like about it: the standard allows
broadcasters to transmit TV signals with up to 4K HDR and better audio. ATSC
3.0 also includes data transmission features for better program guides,
interactive apps and, eventually, advertising services.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Most people aren’t currently able to watch over-the-air
broadcasts in ATSC 3.0<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The first tests of ATSC 3.0 began a decade ago. The FCC
gave the full go-ahead for the new standard in 2017, and local broadcasters
have gradually been adding ATSC 3.0 feeds ever since. In early 2023,
broadcasters were utilizing ATSC 3.0 in around 50 local markets, including Los
Angeles, Portland, and Washington, DC. By the end of the year, 75 percent of US
households will have access to ATSC 3.0, according to Pearl TV, a broadcaster
group that’s promoting the standard under the Nextgen TV moniker.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Consumer adoption is another story. Most people aren’t
currently able to watch over-the-air broadcasts in ATSC 3.0, even if they live
in a market where it has been rolled out. While any existing antenna can
receive ATSC 3.0 signals, the same isn’t true for TVs. ATSC 3.0 is not
backward-compatible with ATSC 1.0, the current broadcast standard, and most
existing TVs can only receive ATSC 1.0 signals. Manufacturers like Samsung and
LG began equipping some of their higher-end TV sets with ATSC 3.0 tuners in recent
years, and Sony is even building a tuner for the new format into every new TV
sold in the United States. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>However, adding ATSC 3.0 compatibility raises the
component costs of a TV, which is why many makers of budget-priced TV sets have
so far been shunning the new format. “The current VIZIO TVs on the market do
not include ATSC 3.0 tuners,” a Vizio spokesperson told us after CES in
January. TCL, known for its low-price Roku TVs, also remains on the sidelines.
“We will not incorporate ATSC 3.0 in (the) first half of 2023, as consumer
demand for the functionality is still low,” a spokesperson told us. “We will continue
to watch the market and adjust when needed.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>How new hardware can help<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>With most TVs not supporting ATSC 3.0 out of the box,
external hardware could be key to the adoption of the format. That’s where
Nuvyyo, a small Canadian startup best known for its Tablo DVRs, comes in.
Regulatory filings show that Scripps acquired Nuvyyo for less than $14 million
in cash in January of 2022; the startup had raised $10 million over two rounds
since it was founded a decade earlier. The modest price tag speaks to how
difficult it is to innovate in the over-the-air television space.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Nuvyyo’s Tablo DVRs have become a favorite among cord
cutting enthusiasts, but Tablo’s value proposition has been harder to explain
to the average consumer. Most of Tablo’s devices don’t directly connect to a TV
but instead capture over-the-air TV signals and then serve the resulting
recordings over Wi-Fi. This whole-home DVR setup makes it possible to stream
recorded TV shows to a wide range of devices, including phones and tablets, on
the go, but it also is a lot more complicated than just hooking up a Roku to
your TV. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The fact that Tablo charges a monthly service fee for
access to its program guide hasn’t exactly helped with adoption. Over 10 years,
Nuvyyo has shipped just over 200,000 Tablos, and the company currently has
around 80,000 active customers, according to the LinkedIn bio of its VP of
finance. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>“Not everyone wants to change their TV for new
technology.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Still, Scripps has big plans for Tablo DVRs. “It’s a very
important project to us,” said Scripps Networks chief distribution officer
Jeffrey Wolf in a conversation with The Verge. Wolf didn’t share any details on
how exactly Scripps plans to use Tablo going forward but said that it was “a
critical piece” of the company’s push towards broader over-the-air adoption — a
push that also includes a marketing campaign dubbed The Free TV Project.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Wolf argued that an over-the-air DVR could make cord
cutting more convenient and help over-the-air networks compete with streaming
services. “It allows viewers to watch over-the-air content essentially on
demand,” as Wolf put it.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Perhaps just as important is that Nuvyyo has been working
on tech to make its DVRs and existing TV sets futureproof. The startup
experimented with a cloud DVR in the past and in early 2022 announced its first
device supporting the new ATSC 3.0 broadcast standard. Wolf didn’t want to
spill the beans on how exactly his company intends to use Tablo, but he hinted
at plans to use the company’s future devices to aid the transition to ATSC 3.0.
“Not everyone wants to change their TV for new technology,” he said. “Converters
or dongles are going to be important pieces of the success of that transition.”
<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4K support is still MIA<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>There are other reasons consumer adoption is lagging.
Even viewers who happen to have a compatible TV and live in a market where ATSC
3.0 is available quickly find that the broadcasts aren’t all they’re cracked up
to be. ATSC 3.0 may, in theory, support 4K HDR, but at this point, 4K
broadcasts are virtually nonexistent in the United States.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>One reason for this is that the FCC decided against a
hard transition to ATSC 3.0 that would have left everyone without a compatible
device in the dark. “We have to both offer our current services (ATSC 1.0)
while also offering the 3.0 signal,” explained Alex Siciliano, a spokesperson
for the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB). The FCC currently mandates
that stations transitioning to ATSC 3.0 keep their legacy signals up and
running for at least five years, but it could extend that timeline.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The transition to ATSC 3.0 is “stalled” and “in peril,”
broadcasters say<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>To achieve dual support with a limited amount of
spectrum, broadcasters partner with each other in local markets. A local ABC
affiliate may, for instance, switch to ATSC 3.0 and also carry the local NBC
and FOX stations in the new format. In exchange, those stations will continue
to broadcast the ABC station’s signal in the legacy ATSC 1.0 format — an
approach known in the industry as “lighthousing” that simply doesn’t leave
enough bandwidth for 4K signals. “We are spectrum-constrained,” admitted Pearl TV’s
managing director, Anne Schelle.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The transition to ATSC 3.0 is “stalled” and “in peril”
due to regulatory inaction, the NAB wrote in a letter to the FCC earlier this
year. Highlighting the 4K issue, broadcasters called for “a plan to eventually
end the wasteful dual transmission in both ATSC 1.0 and ATSC 3.0” and suggested
that an FCC task force should come up with a firmer transition timeline.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>“It is time for the FCC to take a more active role,” said
Siciliano, adding that it wasn’t in the commission’s interest to “leave behind
viewers — especially those that rely solely on over-the-air TV for their news
and information.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Free streaming channels are booming<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Antenna usage remains popular, especially among
lower-income and immigrant households. Eighteen percent of TV viewers told
market researchers last year that they owned an antenna. Among Latinx
audiences, one in four viewers said they owned an antenna. The Consumer
Technology Association estimates that there will be around 8.5 million antenna
sales this year alone.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Those numbers have prompted Scripps to bet big on
over-the-air television. With cable TV audiences declining, over-the-air seemed
like the best bet to reach millions of eyeballs that the company can then
monetize with advertising. In addition to buying up dozens of local broadcast
stations, the company spent around $300 million on broadcast-only BET
competitor Bounce in 2017, followed by the $2.65 billion acquisition of the
over-the-air networks Ion as well as associated spectrum in 2020.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>But while Scripps was busy pouring billions into
broadcast networks and infrastructure, another way to watch linear television
emerged: free, ad-supported streaming channels. Turn on any smart TV these
days, and you’ll find program guides with hundreds of TV channels featuring
familiar names like AMC, NBC and FOX, with no need to pay for cable or hook up
an antenna.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The Tablo Dual Lite over-the-air DVR. Image: Nuvyyo<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>These free linear channels have been a big hit with
audiences and advertisers: Samsung alone claims to stream more than 3 billion
hours of free linear programming to its smart TVs per year, and advertisers are
expected to spend more than $4 billion on domestic linear streaming services
this year — ad revenue that directly benefits TV makers, unlike those costly
ATSC 3.0 tuners.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Today, many media companies still use these so-called
FAST channels as a way to make some extra money with older shows. AMC, for
instance, doesn’t stream its cable channel to smart TV viewers, in part because
it has exclusive deals with cable TV services. Instead, it has dedicated FAST
channels for back-to-back The Walking Dead and Portlandia reruns.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>However, some broadcasters have begun to retransmit their
linear feeds as FAST channels. Scripps, for instance, has been streaming its
Ion and Bounce broadcast networks in their entirety, and the explosive growth
of FAST is not lost on the company. “When we track audience levels for over the
air, we’re generally looking at how we’re doing year over year because it’s
kind of a slower-moving train at this point,” said Scripps Networks chief
research officer Jon Marks. “When we look at FAST, we’re looking at it quarter
by quarter because that’s how fast it’s growing.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>In light of these changes, Scripps is hedging its bets.
The company plans to keep promoting over-the-air viewing and also talk more
publicly about its plans for Tablo in the coming months. Scripps also remains
committed to ATSC 3.0, which will be a quality improvement even without 4K.
“Our networks right now are mostly SD,” Wolf said. “The ability to put our
product out there in HD will change the value of our proposition.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>But it’s also looking to invest more into free streaming.
For the first time, the company aims to launch a new TV network on FAST
services this spring and then bring it to antenna audiences if it does well
with streamers. Marks still doesn’t expect linear streaming to overtake over
the air from an audience size perspective any time soon. Then again, with the
transition to ATSC 3.0 moving as slow as it is, it’s possible that free
streaming will eventually leapfrog over-the-air broadcasting and turn into the de
facto future of free TV while antennas slowly become irrelevant.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>“Right now, the best use of our spectrum is building
over-the-air broadcast networks,” said Wolf. “Is that the path of the future?
Time will tell.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>On average in 2023, Americans spend 5.5 hours per day
watching TV/video, up slightly from 5.2 hours in 2021, with year-over-year
growth in over-the-air (OTA) broadcast TV and free online video viewing leading
the increase. Older Americans (60+ years old) spend two times as many hours
watching traditional linear TV as young adults (18-29 years old), while women
spend more time than men streaming subscription video content according to a
recent Kagan Consumer Insights survey.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol"'>➤</span> On average, Americans spend
5.5 hours per day watching TV/video content, up modestly from 5.2 hours in
2021. The increase is due primarily to an uptick in time spent viewing OTA
broadcast TV and streaming of free video.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol"'>➤</span> Adults 60 years of age and
older spend an average of six hours per day watching TV/video, compared to less
than five hours per day for adults 18-29 years of age. The survey found that
time spent viewing content from traditional linear TV increased with age but
viewing of online video content was essentially flat among those under 50 years
old, then trailed off among older adults.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif;

spend over five hours per day watching TV/video. Men tend to spend more time
watching traditional linear TV, while women spend more time watching content
from streaming subscription services.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>According to the Kagan US first-quarter Consumer Insights
survey and historical survey data, average daily TV/video viewing hours in the
US increased over the past two years, from 5.2 hours per day in 2021 to 5.5
hours this year. The data highlights a modest multiyear growth trend in
watching over-the-air broadcast TV, along with a slight year-over-year uptick
in free video streaming.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The survey results reveal that the average time consumers
spend per day watching TV and video increases with age. For example, the study
found that young adults ages 18-29 spend an average of 4.8 hours per day
watching TV or video content, compared with 6.2 hours per day for those 60
years of age and older. The survey found that older adults (60+) spend the vast
majority of their time (4.7 hours per day) watching traditional linear TV,
defined as content being derived from OTA, traditional multichannel or virtual
multichannel services. In contrast, young adults (ages 18-29) spend 2.6 hours
per day) of their time viewing traditional linear TV.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Examining the data as a percentage of overall viewing
hours helps to further illustrate how TV/video viewing behavior changes across
the various age groups. For instance, 18-29 year olds spend over half (54%) of
their time watching traditional linear TV. 60+ year olds, on the other hand
spend over three quarters (77%) of their time watching traditional linear TV,
and only 13% streaming live video. The survey data also shows that
20-somethings (18-29) spend 22% of their time streaming subscription video content,
more than double that of those 60+ years of age.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The survey also found that average daily viewing hours in
total were not substantially different among men (5.5 hours) and women (5.4
hours). However, the data shows that men tend to spend more time viewing
traditional linear TV than women, possibly due to watching sports. Women tend
to spend more time than men watching content from subscription video streaming
services, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>When looking at the percentage of time spent viewing
TV/video, the survey data shows that men spend over two-thirds (69%) of their
average daily TV/video viewing hours watching traditional linear TV, compared
to 63% for women. SVOD content represents 19% of TV/video viewing for women,
five percentage points higher than men. Overall, women spend 37% of their
average daily TV/video viewing hours watching online content, compared to 30%

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Disney<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Former Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes believes that of all
the new entrants, only Disney will succeed. Just before the one-year
anniversary of Disney Plus’ launch, CEO Bob Chapek announced a monstrous
reorganization for the company’s streaming division — one that affects nearly
every part of the company. Various divisions have been consolidated into one
main section — Media and Entertainment — with one of Chapek’s right-hand men
from his time in the parks division, Kareem Daniel, overseeing the newly renamed
arm. As executives shuffle around, Chapek and the company also issued a public
release confirming Disney’s future priorities are streaming-first. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Disney hasn’t shied away from its streaming ambitions.
Disney Plus launched in November 2019, and since then, it has amassed more than
60 million subscribers. Alongside Disney’s other streaming initiatives — Hulu
and ESPN Plus — Disney has more than 100 million subscribers paying monthly for
its various offerings. Disney Plus has grown so quickly that even Netflix CEO
Reed Hastings noted in a Netflix earnings call that over the last 20 years,
“I’ve never seen such a good execution of the incumbent learning the new way
and mastering it.” <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>“To see both the execution and the numbers line up, my
hat’s off to them,” Hastings said.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Within that same time frame, Disney has seen the exits of
many of the executives who oversaw the launch of Disney Plus, acquisition of
Hulu, and reformation of ESPN Plus. Kevin Mayer, once considered the House of
Mouse’s king-in-waiting, left to become TikTok’s CEO for about 100 days after
Disney appointed Chapek to CEO. Agnes Chu, who oversaw original content for
Disney Plus, left not long after. Ricky Strauss, one of the final executive
members of the Disney Plus team, has disappeared into the background. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Under the new reorganization, Disney is seemingly giving
more power to those who already had it. Studio and network heads are able to
“make the call about whether a project is destined for theatrical, linear TV or
streaming distribution,” according to The Hollywood Reporter. The change makes
sense for anyone who has been closely following Disney’s moves — ask the
creative powers to make more for Disney’s streaming platforms, but give them
more say over what that looks like. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Although the announcement is new, the priority shift is
not. John Landgraf, the head of FX, has spent months moving some of the
channel’s series over to Hulu as Disney tries to grow its “FX on Hulu” arm. The
goal is to bring even more viewers into Disney’s domestic, general streaming
platform — and ideally boost subscriptions to its other services, too. More
recently, Disney is also moving some of its best writers and analysts’ pieces
to ESPN Plus, realigning ESPN’s news arm to fit within the goals of streaming.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Like every company listed here, many of Disney’s main
businesses were harmed by the COVID-19 pandemic — and the company is
readjusting its priorities to grow the one sector that is booming. People are
continuing to cut cable (not great for ESPN), ratings are mostly down on linear
TV channels (not great for ABC, FX, and Disney Channel), and audiences are
stuck at home (not great for movie theaters or theme parks). But streaming
isn’t about to disappear. Disney’s reorganization simply acknowledges streaming
is the only thing working for the company right now.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>AT&amp;T underwent two major executive changes a few
months ago that set the company and its WarnerMedia division up for a
never-ending series of reorganizations: John Stankey took over for Randall
Stephenson as AT&amp;T CEO, and former Hulu head Jason Kilar was appointed
WarnerMedia CEO. Under both Stankey and Kilar, directives for WarnerMedia are
clear: turn the company’s entertainment divisions, including cable TV and film,
into a streaming-focused business. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Not long after Kilar joined the company in April, the
reshuffling started. The biggest change came in August when esteemed company

Hulu executive who worked alongside Kilar, took over all of HBO Max. Warner
Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff and HBO programming president Casey Bloys were selected
to oversee a new group that combines WarnerMedia’s studios and networks. Much
like Disney, the reorg gave certain executives more consolidated power over
their content and distribution streams, with an emphasis on prioritizing HBO
Max. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The restructuring didn’t stop there. WarnerMedia
restructured its WarnerMax division — a new studio arm created at the beginning
of 2020 to make low-budget, independent films specifically for HBO Max — as
part of an ongoing process to phase out the division altogether. Warner Bros.
Pictures Group chairman Toby Emmerich was given even more power and
responsibility, now in charge of overseeing all film distribution for both
theatrical and streaming. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Although WarnerMedia and AT&amp;T executives are changing
the company to build out its streaming initiatives, HBO Max isn’t growing as
fast as some industry critics may have hoped. AT&amp;T reported that HBO Max
has seen just over 8 million activations since it launched at the end of May,
with 28.7 million customers eligible for the streaming service by the end of
the company’s most recent quarter. Stankey has downplayed those concerns,
saying they’re mostly on track but would have likely seen a better launch had the
pandemic not affected rollout of original series and specials. But one thing’s
for sure: HBO Max isn’t seeing the kind of success that Disney Plus did
initially. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>HBO Max needs to pay off for AT&amp;T — especially as
other parts of AT&amp;T’s television businesses flounder. People aren’t paying
for cable bundles anymore. Even if they want access to TNT for basketball
games, a lot of customers don’t want the other networks that come with it —
especially when content from those networks wind up on Netflix, Hulu, Peacock,
or Amazon Prime Video a short while later. AT&amp;T needs those customers
cutting their cable and other TV packages to transition over to HBO Max.
Although AT&amp;T boasts that HBO Max has more than 28 million subscribers, the
company includes people who are eligible but have not activated those
subscriptions; 70 percent of those eligible to use HBO Max for free as part of
an upgrade have yet to do so, according to Variety.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The future of WarnerMedia in both Kilar and Stankey’s
eyes is HBO Max. The next hurdle is figuring out how to get people to sign up
and actively use the service. Kilar and Stankey have a few ideas, including
rolling out an ad-supported cheaper tier next year to try to convince people
who don’t want to spend $15 a month. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>NBCUniversal<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>NBCUniversal’s reorganizations started in late 2019. The
company announced that Jeff Shell would take over for Steve Burke as the head
of NBCUniversal, facing a major task — figure out how to turn NBCUniversal into
a proper streaming business. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Then in May, Shell appointed Mark Lazarus as the head of
a new division simply called NBCUniversal Television and Streaming. Lazarus’
province would include everything from NBC’s main broadcast network to cable
channels like USA and Bravo, as well as international networks, according to
The Wall Street Journal. Lazarus, who came in at the same time that many of the
individual networks were moving executives around, was faced with two main
priorities: keeping football on NBC and turning Peacock, NBCUniversal’s new
streaming service that offered both ad-free and ad-supported options being run
by Matt Strauss, into an important revenue business for NBCUniversal. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>By August, there were more shake-ups as Lazarus and Shell
tried to figure out how to reorganize its TV division, including creating an
Entertainment Programming unit that includes figuring out content for Peacock.
By then, Peacock had more than 10 million subscribers. It’s unclear how many of
those are paying $10 a month or watching through the cheaper or free
ad-supported versions.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Like Disney and WarnerMedia, NBCUniversal hasn’t tried to
shy away from Peacock being a top priority. Unlike Disney Plus, however,
Peacock also wants to attract top-paying advertiser dollars, with NBCUniversal
developing new ad tech to appeal to the biggest companies. The streamer, which
launched nationwide in July, last reported having more than 15 million
subscribers.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The throughline between all of these restructurings is
consolidation and tightening, especially in areas that continue to wallow. In
September, The Wall Street Journal reported that Shell was looking into further
reorganizing that would continue to focus on streaming and less on linear or
cable TV networks that people weren’t tuning into. The Journal reported that
Shell is “centralizing decision-making — from which shows get made to which
networks those shows should run on — and dramatically slimming down the cable
unit in the process.” Sound familiar by now? <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Planned layoffs are still set to come, according to
reports from multiple publications. Those cuts will work to get rid of
redundancies, and they’ll also target parts of NBCUniversal’s businesses that
were already faltering. Continued major losses in cable and lower ratings are
an easy target — especially when NBCUniversal can move both customers and
advertisers to Peacock. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>ViacomCBS<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>ViacomCBS is one of the more interesting companies
because it’s technically been in the streaming game the longest, but arguably
one of the last to the party. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>CBS All Access, ViacomCBS’s primary subscription
on-demand streaming service, launched in 2014. It boasted a pretty big library
of classic shows, but CBS could only do so much to attract people. The service
was not playing NFL games at the time.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Then, in 2019, Viacom and CBS announced their
long-anticipated merger — and CEO Bob Bakish started moving all the different
pieces. Just a few months after the merger was announced, the company started
moving executives around. Marc DeBevoise, who helped oversee the launch of CBS
All Access, was named head of all things digital, including streaming
initiatives. Tom Ryan, the head of Pluto TV, one of ViacomCBS’s other streaming
services, would continue reporting directly to Bakish. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Almost one year later, things changed. Ryan was promoted
this month to CEO of ViacomCBS Streaming. Ryan’s promotion came alongside the
announcement that DeBevoise is stepping down. DeBevoise would instead stay on
through 2020 and act as an adviser to Ryan. Considering that Ryan saw Pluto TV
through the merger, and noting just how big a role Pluto TV, which has more
than 33 million monthly active users globally, will play in ViacomCBS’s
streaming future, it’s not too surprising. Just to make everything slightly
more confusing, the company also announced that CBS All Access would be renamed
to Paramount Plus.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Similar to NBCUniversal, ViacomCBS is reportedly
considering shutting down entire networks, according to CNBC. Although nothing
is imminent, CNBC’s report adds, a cursory glance at the company’s designated
pillars for its streaming platforms shows where the company is investing (BET,
Nickelodeon, Paramount, MTV) and where the company likely isn’t (VH1, PopTV,
Logo). Strategically, ViacomCBS is doing the same thing Disney did — bet on
core properties that will drive subscribers to streaming platforms, and consolidate
elsewhere to cut costs. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>“If you are going to differentiate yourself, every
incremental dollar you can put into the development of that content becomes
important,” Greg Portell, head of global consumer industries at consultancy
firm Kearney, said. “That means a lot of these companies that have gotten
bloated over the years, and they really need to stream that down.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The bottom line is that if all these companies want to be
in on streaming, it means they have to slim down and abandon other parts of
their business that have become dinosaurs. In many cases, that means shedding
cable networks. In others, it’s layoffs to target redundancy. Disney,
WarnerMedia, NBCUniversal, and ViacomCBS have shown no sign of trying to fight
the future — now they just have to determine if they can find a seat at the
table. Portell calls it a true “game of winners and losers.” In the midst of
great acceleration affecting every industry, Portell also said it’s adamantly
clear, “we’re about to see who those winners are much more quickly.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The full US pay-TV market lost a record 2.37 million

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The rough times in pay-TV got even rougher in the first
quarter of the year.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>US pay-TV providers, including virtual multichannel video
programming distributors (vMVPDs), combined to shed a record 2.37 million
subscribers in the first quarter of 2024, according to the latest estimates
from MoffettNathanson. Those losses compared to a year-ago loss of 2.35
million.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Traditional pay-TV operators (cable, satellite and
telcos) lost a combined 1.90 million subs in the quarter.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Within that traditional grouping, US cable operators took
it on the chin the hardest. They combined to lose 1.14 million subs in Q1 2024,
a tick below the 1.11 million they lost in the year-ago period.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>US satellite operators (Dish and DirecTV) lost 589,000,
an improvement from a year-ago loss of 759,000 subs. US telcos were estimated
to lose about 168,000, a bit better than the 211,000 they lost in the year-ago
period.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>vMVPDs, once again, did not pick up the slack, losing
469,000 subscribers in the first quarter of 2024, widened from a year-ago loss
of 265,000.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The vMVPD &quot;conversion rate&quot; (the rate at which
traditional video sub losses are re-captured by vMVPDs) was just 28.2% in the
first quarter of 2024.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;To state the obvious, the vMVPDs are not a panacea
for linear video,&quot; MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett noted in his
latest &quot;Cord-Cutting Monitor&quot; report (registration required).<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The rate of decline in pay TV, excluding the vMVPDs,
dropped to an all-time worst of -12.3%. With vMVPDs included, the rate of
decline was about -6.9% – also a record low.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>YouTube TV's first quarter loss<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The quarter was so bad that even YouTube TV apparently
did not get out of it unscathed.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>YouTube TV, a streaming service that has been able to
buck the trend in pay TV and dominate the vMVPD market, likely lost subscribers
for the first time, according to Moffett's analysis.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Google does not disclose quarterly subscriber numbers for
YouTube TV, but Moffett believes YouTube TV lost about 150,000 subscribers in
the first quarter, off from an estimated gain of 250,000 in the year-ago
period. The analyst attributed the loss in Q1 to customer churn linked to NFL
Sunday Ticket, the out-of-market football package that is now exclusively
distributed via YouTube and YouTube TV.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Most other vMVPDs didn't fare well in the quarter, either
– Hulu's live TV service lost about 100,000 while Dish-owned Sling TV shed
135,000 and Fubo lost 107,000. DirecTV Stream, with a small gain of about
23,000 subs, was the outlier, according to Moffett's estimate.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>When US pay TV swung to its prior record subscriber
losses in Q1 2023, Moffett referenced twin &quot;doom loops&quot; that
illustrated the gloom encompassing pay TV – rising prices and the
&quot;strip-mining&quot; of quality content from linear TV networks to
direct-to-consumer streaming services that ultimately sap the value of the
pay-TV bundle.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>In his latest report, Moffett identified another doom
loop or &quot;wheel&quot; in which ad spending on streaming is growing faster
than subscribers on the streaming platforms themselves, thus &quot;further
undermining the traditional ecosystem.&quot;<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;As the media conglomerates have increasingly
embraced ad-supported tiers for streamers like Hulu, Peacock and now more
recently Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video, advertisers have dutifully
followed, increasingly moving their ad budgets to the new, new thing,&quot;
Moffett explained. &quot;Like the other two doom loops, this ad budget
migration is self-reinforcing. Advertisers move budgets. Management teams,
chasing those budgets, move even more marquee content to streaming. Advertisers
therefore move even more of their budgets. Importantly, the three 'wheels' are
mutually reinforcing; each of the three makes the other two spin faster.&quot;<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>A federal judge in New York blocked the upcoming live
sports streaming service from Disney, Fox, and Warner Bros. Discovery, siding
with streamer Fubo that the package likely violates antitrust law. Fubo argued
in an antitrust complaint that the partnership was the culmination of “a
years-long campaign to block Fubo’s innovative sports-first streaming
business.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The three entertainment companies had sought to create a
new streaming service called Venu Sports that would launch this fall and charge
$42.99 a month for access to networks across their portfolios, including ESPN,
Fox Sports, and TNT. Bundling the sports content from all three companies would
put other distributors like Fubo at “an extreme competitive disadvantage,” Fubo
said at the time. DirecTV and Dish sided with Fubo in the case.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Fubo drops Discovery networks and blasts WBD for abusing
its power<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The deal also raised alarms for lawmakers like Sen.
Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Rep. Joaquin Castro
(D-TX), who recently asked federal enforcers to investigate. They warned the
joint venture (JV) could put the companies “in a position to exercise monopoly
power over televised sports” and effectively require competitors to negotiate
with the JV companies “for access to over half of the major sporting licensing
rights while simultaneously competing against these companies to offer the best
product to broadcast or stream these programs.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Related<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The ultimate sports streaming service will have to fight
itself<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Streaming services keep getting more expensive: all the
latest price increases<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Southern District of New York Judge Margaret Garnett said
Fubo would likely succeed on the merits in arguing the deal violates the
Clayton Act, which governs mergers and acquisitions, and granted a preliminary
injunction blocking it.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>“Put simply, the antitrust problem presented by the JV is
as follows: if the JV is allowed to launch, it will be the only option on the
market for those television consumers who want to spend their money on multiple
live sports channels they love to watch, but not on superfluous entertainment
channels they do not,” Garnett wrote. “And the JV’s corporate owners—the JV
Defendants—are the same players that (1) used their longstanding bundling
practices to create the void in the pay TV market tailor-made for the
live-sports-only JV to fill, and also (2) exercise near-monopolistic control
over the ability for a different live-sports-only streaming service to exist
and compete with the JV.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Fubo co-founder and CEO David Gandler called the decision
a victory for both Fubo and consumers. “This decision will help ensure that
consumers have access to a more competitive marketplace with multiple sports
streaming options,” he said in a statement. “But our fight continues. Fubo has
said all along that we seek equal treatment from these media giants, and a
level playing field in our industry. The proposed joint venture was only the
latest example of anticompetitive practices that The Walt Disney Company, FOX
Corp. and Warner Bros. Discovery have consistently engaged in for many years.
We believe these practices monopolize the market, stifle competition and cheat
consumers from deserved choice.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>
